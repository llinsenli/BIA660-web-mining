1,I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product
0,"I called Barry Farm and spoke with two women to find out if there is any possible gluten contamination with the beans. Neither knew if the beans could have gluten on them because they are from a supplier and don't actually grow them. When I asked who the supplier was she rather curtly said, ""I will not give out the names of my suppliers"". I found that odd, on so many levels, and wondered if her suppliers are in China. A company has never refused to give me their supplier before. The best part was telling me I could wash the gluten off when I rinsed the beans. Due to all the recall mania, I am not willing to gamble my family's health. Anyone else wondering what they do grow at Barry Farm? The whole thing left me with the heebie-jeebies."
0,"I like Clay and bought the cd, but save your money and download the songs from the show, they are MUCH better. He is so good and this cd is so bad. What happened? Just a rush to get it out? You have the talent, just pick better songs next time."
0,"As a US fan, I was certainly irritated that this was not released in the US and that I had to pay $23 for it as an import. This irritation was compounded when I sat down and listened to the album. This is not a bad album, for most bands it would be a solid effort, but I expect more from Sloan. What this album lacks is variety and subtlety. Most of the songs are just a little too straightforward. Other reviewers have commented on the repetitive guitar riffs and lyrics, and I agree.If you are big Sloan fan, you will probably want this, otherwise its a coin toss."
1,"I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."
0,"While I liked the overall packaged for this film (The behind the scenes information, the small comic book) The movie was really bad. Keanu Reeves did not cut it in the main role and the script was so badly written that you actually thought of better dialog in your head while you are watching it. I agree with a lot of what has been said about Rachel Weisz and her great performance but not even her great effort could have saved it from it's own bad script and it's really bad leading man.My one star review goes to Rachel Weisz and the slick DVD extras but the movie gets an no stars from me ."
1,"JFC Fuller has always been erudite and his reaction to the general-ship in World War I makes an excellent read.I however do wish that the digitisation had been better since each page needs a change of font size in this Kindle edition, when read on an I pad."
1,"If you are sitting at home and watching a television show you have seen 5 times before, pick up the 20Q for hours of fun instead. Whatever is on your mind this little computer guesser can figgure it out. From Lizzard to Poop it is all in here. Give in a try and you will be hooked!"
1,This is a fantastic and near perfect game. The only minor imperfections are lack of some gameplay features that are added in the sequel. The characters are very interesting and unlike most games are not mere cliches to create gameplay. It does not have any fan service at all and is better because of it.
0,"Painfully, painfully, painfully bad! At first it's just the bad writing and the stock cardboard characters. If you're looking for psychological nuance or complexity, don't open this book. Thank God the author spared us the love scenes! But by the time the secrets are revealed, the book has descended into a comic awfulness reserved for only the greatest bad books. I was writhing and groaning on my couch. If your book club is used to reading good books, have them read this one sometime, and then sit around like the guys in Mystery Science Theater and have a great time poking fun at it. But hey, it was a best seller! Says a lot about us doesn't it?!"
1,"I don't understand why some people expect Brian Mcknight's new music to sound just like his old music. If I wanted to hear his old cds then I would pull them out of my cd case. Every time an artist puts out a cd, in some way it reflects HIS experiences in life. Not his fans. We should be thankful that a such a talented musican, singer-songwriter gives us the privilege of sharing it with him. I'm just happy to have another Brian Mcknight cd to add to my collection."
0,If it wasnt for the suspense and the sudden frightenly few moments in the movie I would have given it 1 star.
0,"Slow, Dark, Brooding and those are the nicest things I could say. This is one of the very few books I have truly wished I could return and get my money back. I love historical mysteries - but I didn't care what happened in this one because the characters were so uninteresting."
0,What the ..... is this hand drawn basic illustration junk?Must have had his kid do the drawing or something.This book is a total rip off and that's being super kind. not a single useful new idea or jig.Books like this makes you not want to ever buy another book.one star only Because couldn't do zero star.Straight into trash!!!
0,"I've been wearing Chucks for years now, but the pair that I purchased from shoezoo fell apart after 2 months. The sole of the shoe completely ripped off the rest of the shoe, and I've only used these shoes for casual walking. Pretty ridiculous."
0,"Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
0,"As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!"
1,I collect old hymnals and lived in Mennonite country for a few years. 606 is the Mennonite Doxology. It's an awesome arrangement that is sung so beautifully a capella by the Mennonites. So glad to have my own copy of this!
1,The quality of the product was perfect. Brand new. It was sent out it two days. I was very satisfied.
0,"I bought this to recharge my phone, garmin, etc. It looks like the authentic Motorola recharger, but it won't recharge anything. Sure, it keeps the device working, almost, your device will run out of power eventually on this recharger, but slowly. However, I figured it would recharge the Garmin, etc, during use like my other rechargers did. I thought perhaps the LED light was using up too much power. I dismantled the thing after a great deal of effort and injury, and knocked out the light. It will now charge my Garmin very well. I don't recommend this product."
0,"As soon as this movie started and I saw ""WWE"" on my TV screen I said ""This is gonna suck."" And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie clich and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk."
0,"After trying to work around the issue for days, I got on line with HP customer support. This printer will not print a pdf from acrobat. If you want the ability to print a PDF, you have to download a third party program (FinePrint) set it as your default ""printer"" to which you ""print"" all your documents, and then print to the printer from FinePrint. As I work in a business in which a LOT of documents are electronic, and in PDF format, the printer is worthless. Even on the HP website, on THIS printer's data page, there is a ""Printable Data Sheet"" in PDF format. Well, on any other printer in the world, it would be ""printable."" Not on this little paperweight."
0,"Aside from a few tracks, namely the memorable airship theme and few others, the CD isn't much more than a novelty; something to add to your collection. But look at it this way - it's Uematsu! Really, you can't much go wrong there..."
1,"This book does give a good introduction to programming neural networks in C++. The author has a good grasp of object oriented design and he shows how to exploit this in the construction of certain kinds of neural networks. The code in the book is flexable and fairly well laid out. I was able to port it to Java with relatively few alterations.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in starting to program neural nets. It probably requires a little background in C++, but the primer in the beginning of the book actually taught me something (I read this book a year ago when I was fairly new to OOP)!"
1,"John Steinback is famous for writing book that took place during the Great Depression. Steinback's book ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two men, Lennie and George ,trying to reach their dream of ""living off of the fat of the land"", in other words they want to own their own land, be their own boss. While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch.In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much. Also, the ending of this book was very tragic and sad. I would recommend this book to any age because its a classic story that many people have loved and still rememeber after they read it."
0,"This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing."

0,"I HAVE READ, LISTENED TO AND VIEWED 100'S OF BOOKS, MOVIES ETC. SHADES OF GRAY VIDEO IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE. THE BOOK HOWEVER PROMISES TO BE SUPERIOR READING BY ALL ACCOUNTS, I ENDORSE THE BOOK IN ADVANCE TRUST ME. I AM ABSOLUTELY MIFFED AT THE INFERIOR QUALITY OF THE DVD WHICH ALLEGES TO SERVE AS A PRELUDE IN SOME WAY. I MAY NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN FROM AMAZON BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO. ALL OTHER MATERIAL AND SHIPPING ISSUES HAVE BEEN SUPERIOR. I LOST 10.00 ON THE VIDEO."
1,"I've been a fan of the Donna Richardson step and awesome abs video and was very pleased with the 4-day rotation video. I work full time plus have 2-young kids so the 15-minute work-outs are great for me. The only thing negative I have to say is that at times Donna and the two friends seemed to be talking simultaneously which was irritating and made it hard to understand Donna. Also, participants in the video should be aware that users will have to hear what they say over and over again--So I really find it irritating when one of the friend says, 'Now we're cooking' in a particulary annoying voice--I'd give anything to delete that!! However, all in all, a great video."
1,"If you've ever eaten ""doubles"" on the street in Trinidad and wondered how to reproduce that delightful flavor at home, this is the book to use. The recipes are true native specialties, described so anyone can enjoy them."
1,I save from .04 to.07 per diaper (depending on sizes I have autoshipped and mr mom deductions) as opposed to walmart's price. This adds up to a minimum savings of $7.68 per box up to well over $10 per box on smaller sizes. I have 3 in diapers.
1,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was set during the Great Depression in CA. In this book there are two characters called Lennie and George. They are the two migrant workers, who had travel together and they want to save some money and buy a ranch of their own. George is a small person, quick and dark of face. He always takes care of Lennie and he act like a father to Lennie. Lennie is a huge man and has a mind of a child. He always gets into trouble. Every time when Lennie gets into trouble, George always gets him out of the trouble. Lennie acts like a son to George. Will George and Lennie make their dream come true or will Lennies weak mind and strong body destroy their dream?The book Of Mice and Men is a good book. I will rate it as four stars. In this book, it has a lot of conflicts and events. Also it tells us how important friendship is event if it is a very hard time. Friendship will help you get through anything."
1,"I was surprised by how much I liked this book. I had heard people talk of it forever and always put it in my mind as a book to read, but I didn't think that it would necessarily be an enjoyable read. I finally got around to reading it when I heard that Michael Moore's new movie is titled after this book. (Fahrenheit 9/11 The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns)So about the book... It is not only a good story with a strong message regarding freedom of speech. It is beautifully written and very easy to read. The words flow, and each character is perfect in their contribution to the story. This book is pretty short. I think it is a must read for anyone. I'm not going to say more, because you have to read it for yourself!"
1,I am a very big fan of Sammy Davis Jr. I had never heard of this movie. I was really impressed. Great acting. A lot of future stars. Highly recommend!!!

1,"I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
0,"This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere."
0,"What we have here is an academic paper puffed into a book.If one has the patience to wade through his tedious repetitions, condescensions, ax grinding, and self-congratulations, one is rewarded with the glimmer of a new idea. But that idea, recedes mirage-like, ever into the horizon. I don't know how I ever made it through.It's disappointing that Kingsley fails to locate his work within the context of Ganzfeld parapsychology, or even of Sumer, the source culture of the ancients. I was amused to find that despite what he believes to be his breakthrough insights, he is ignored by other scholars.Nice try, Peter, but you owe us much better. Next time, at the very least, give us a useful table of contents, a readable list of references, and an index."
1,"This is a wonderful abbreviated version about a great man of his century that could take up volumes and volumes. The tome was informative, precise and a joy to wander through this man's accomplishments. It's not necessary to list everything that should be in his obit - read it. It will be worth your while."
1,"Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio."
1,"Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. Why she didn't sing and stretch like these years ago is beyond me, but she soars along with the hot group of musicians and singers with her. I have been playing this CD for months since I got it and I can't seem to get enough. I would have loved to see her tour with this ensemble of musicians with her, but I think she only played in Nashville last January.Here's to hoping she records more bluegrass, but until then I'll give The Grass is Blue another spin."
0,"I do not recommend this book is so unsubstantiated, vague, and unscientifically presented, nothing new."
1,"This is just Five Faces Of Darkness, the five part third season premier from the original Transformers TV show. If you grew up back then, like me, then you should have already seen this yourself back in the day. If you didn't, or you're new to G1 shows, this is ok but not essential to your enjoying The Transformers: The Movie. The F.H.E. Video of these episodes has been available for rent at my local ... for years & years. Since it's not likely to be available here, check your ... or, better yet, go to ..., check out the CTLP and get your episodes on VHS from one of the many video traders/sellers who have many if not all G1 episodes on tape. That's what I did for the episodes I wanted that haven't been released by Rhino Video yet."
0,"The weights in my old weight vest have started to desintegrate so it was time for a new one. The price is right and other reviews were very positive. On reviewer who said she was 5'2"" found it too short. I did not think this would be a problem for me because I am considerably taller, 5'7"". However it is too long...sits on the hips rather than hanging from the shoulders and ending at the waist line like my old one does. I do not think it will be very comfortable so I am sending it back. Also, I thought the illustration I looked at showed it as black. It is white, not attractive (How attractive can a weight vest be?) and will probably look dirty very soon and have to be laundered a lot."
1,"The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
0,"Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill. Look for my copy on the ""used books"" shelf."
1,"perfect fit, and wonder why I haven't had one for so long. non clinging, full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort."
1,"The author may want to stay more on the subject of the people you are talking about to make it easier to understand, especially if the readers are not from that generation, as I am only 16. Great idea though! Each generation who had to fight in a war should be remembered!!! Telling each person's story made it much more interesting! I liked that I could skip around without much of a problem."
0,"These were so tiny I could just get them over four fingers. Box says ""one size fits most"". Most what? teenage girls? (I'm not a large man, I'm a petite adult woman, fit wasn't even close.)It's really appalling that amazon doesn't a MODICUM of info for items like this (like what's the diameter, the fact that there's NO stretch factor built into these at all.I've learntt my lesson. go to web sites that provide some info for purchases of this kind."
1,This was a fascinating look at mental illness. I could really feel her pain and understand how easy it would be to slip into this state.
1,The copy of the poster was a little larger than expected but I was able to make it work with my Japanese inspired room decor. I wish it came in a smaller size 11x20 or 8x10. I would order if it came in smaller prints.
1,"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's ""Interprettation of Dreams"" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
0,"Unfortunately, this book is just a series of repetitive ""snippets"" that really does little to tell the story of this generation. I am about Brokaw's age and my parents and their brothers and sisters numbered 17 in total. I have heard all the stories, and have three uncles buried in Europe. I found Brocaw with little talent (this book could have been done by a mediocre college sophomore) and a love for ""Brocaw"". Never have I seen a ""talking head"" lever his TV exposure to the extent this guy has. He, like a lot of his generation gave little, reaped plenty and are looking for legitimacy via the accomplishments of their parents.Also, please note he put his name on every other page. Really a tacky work. The ""ME"" generation is true to form !!!!"
0,"To think of the courage it took hollywood to actualy claim that this was taken from Jackson's book ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is amazing. I am a big fan of the book and I'm just writing to tell that there is little simularity's between the movie and the book. Only the names are the same and 1 five minute scene is taken from the book. The rest is from the imagination of the screenwriter. I would think that if you are going to change that much of a plot, then you shouldn't be allowed to advertise it as from the book. However, the special effects are amazing, the acting is well done. They should have put another title to it and changed the names of the charecters. Then it could have been there own work. Very disapointing."
1,"I you are new fan who doesn't know which one of the countless Motoralbums to purchase first then look no further... ""Overkill"" was the first album to get the public's attention. It features concert regular classics such as ""Metropolis"", ""Stay Clean"" and the overkilling title-track.This edition of ""Overkill"" includes an interesting batch of bonus tracks such as the Kinks cover ""Louie Louie"" which was Motorhead's first hit single.All the tracks on this album are headbanging gems and now it is 50% extended. Get it, it's a good choice."

Zojirushi customer service found all kind the excuses not willing to take care of it, they wanted me call service center, which they charging service fee $138- up-front(about the same price for buy a new one)....I will never buy Zojirushi again."
1,"The camera worked great for about 3 weeks and then took a dump. Since this was such an expensive purchase, we contacted the seller and he was more than happy to help us with whatever was necessary to make it right. It's true...satisfaction is the key to success!"
1,There is enough product on the mini pads to go over your entire face and neck. The fragrence of step 1 smells good.Overall this product does work. It definately clears up your face. I didn't use this product everyday since I wasn't sure if this was a product that contained 100% natural ingredients.
0,"This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
1,This is great comedy for adults (for more grown up kids also if allowed with some swearing). Much better than expected. And it has a very fine storyline behind.
1,While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.
1,"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."
1,"i had to read this for my college english class. i'm not much of a reader of the classics, but i was surprised by how much i like this book. an incredible use of satire and wit.although, i will say, i know i wouldn't have gotten as much out of it if it wasn't for the class i was taking. i still found the story and voltaire's implications quite enjoyable."
0,The instructions are the worst I have ever seen! Right now I cannot tell if the d@#$ thing is even cooking rice! Buy one of the cheaper cookers and save yourself a lot of headaches!
1,"The Invisible Invaders was one of many Science fiction films, that was unique in it's story line were invaders came to earth to conquer it by their taking over the bodies of dead people, to destroy the living, who in turn would add to the ranks of the dead invasion force used by the invisible invaders as they wrecked havoc upon the cities of the world. As with most Scifi films of this Era it was a reflection of America's fears of communism, and the possible takeover of the USA by the Soviets."
1,"This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!"
0,"If this isn't ueless, it's certainly misleading. Read the previous review, and don't bother downloading it for your Kindle."
0,"Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
0,I listened to all the reviews I read and let me tell you they are written by fanatics. I love the Scorps. The Scorps used to rock. I wish I could return this concert video in little pieces. The sound is junk the music is limp and the vocals are done. Don't waste you money on this video. Sorry Scorps. Your done..............
0,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a great book. I'd recommend it to people of all ages. It should be required reading for everyone! An excellent book from cover to cover.
0,"If the authors would have told the story like they said it in court then maybe it would be an interesting book but when they change what they previously had stated UNDER OATH just to sell a book than there's no point to read it. This book is obviously just the same old lame story whether you like it or not:""Ex-employee sees the opportunity to make an EASY big bug off his super talented, extraordinary ex-boss.""As you already know, Michael Jackson's success was earned by his hard work and not by writing an untrue book about anyone.It's just sad that to make themselves feel better(or richer)there are people who put down, make up lies about others and take advantage of the success of others to make life easier for themselves. However,there are always people willing to do that like the people that enjoyed reading this book.YOU'RE JUST MAKING THEM RICH..."
1,"Everyone has the diapers they swear by. This work great like the cruisers, but for some reason my daughter tends to get a little red (early stage of rash) when wearing these and we don't get the red with cruisers."
1,Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!
0,The storyline was cliched and the one-liners weren't even funny. The Australian accent from the cute boyfriend was annoying. Piper Perabo can NOT act (even though she's hella cute) and all the coyotes were too pretty. It was distracting. Don't waste your time.
0,It comes with no instructions as to how to set the scale corectly. Nothing. The scale is not accurate I believe because we don't know how to set it correctly.
0,"I thought that the Witch of Blackbird pond was a fairly boring story. Throughout the book there's not anything very exciting that the characters say or do. I also thought that the ending was too happy. Every character in the book was very happy at the end and i thought that it was too much. I think that if i were to give this book a grade it would be a C-. And also, if you're going to read this book, I don't recommend that you should read it if you are under the age of 10. If you like history, romance, and happy endings, then I very strongly recommend this book for you. Otherwise you will most likely find this book very boring."
1,"While I cannot say I absolutely love every song on this CD (because a couple of them sound similar) and would ideally rate it 3.5 stars, I can say it's got a few very good tunes on it, which makes it worth buying. ""Invisible"" is easy to listen to, and the title cut, ""Measure of a Man,"" is one of the CD's strongest efforts and my personal favorite. If you never got around to buying his Idol single ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" w/ ""This is The Night,"" they're included here and are an added bonus. Basically enjoyable and a must for any fan of Clay!"
0,I ordered a BELKIN and received an AMIGO.Not what I ordered and when I complained...I was sent ANOTHER AMIGO.Get a clue. Don't shop Amazon!
1,I bought this DVD for my husband and he watches it over and over... It's hilarious and I am very pleased to have bought it:)
1,"So many great looking, great tasing recipes. Fantastic for us working women who want to put a good meal on the table but have such little time. I've bought her second book too. And I'm buying a set for my nephew and his finance."
0,"holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)"
0,We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.
0,"I have no idea how I was talked into watching this movie. I totally believe this was a waste of good film-and a lot of it. A young Daniel Day Lewis with a hipper Fonz impersonation and a whiney Juliette Binoche. Only Lena Olin was worth watching, but not for any depth or anything. This film actually made a communist invasion dull. I absolutely didn't care for this couple. Below par acting, horrible direction, terrible editing, annoying soundtrack and dialogue so bad I think someone should take away the screenwriter's guild card. Don't waste your time on this one."
0,I purchased this product 3 weeks ago. I purchased this because the ball is soft and doesn't hurt the little guys.I have 4 children that LOVE the game however after use the ball started to rip. It is now ripped from the pole and I have been unable to locate a replacement.
1,"If you like death metal, then this is the C.D and band for you. They currently have 2 c.d's out and if your lucky you can find the original demo tapes floating around. This isn't some cheesy little European death metal band, people of the underground are tuning in to what may soon become the next Dimmu Borgir."
0,"I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
1,"This VCI disc is good. The image is mostly crisp and clear, say above 90%. There are a few frames that are fuzzy and dull. There is no hissing or dropout in the sound. There is a comedy short with Leon Errol. It's image sound is also good.As the other reviewers stated the story and acting are top-notch. Even on the short. I have one other VCI disc and there is a Leon Errol short on it. I had never heard of him. He is actually pretty funny."
0,"One of the most boring books I have ever read. This books jumps around and makes it difficult to read. Also, The Overall story is boring. If you want a book to put you to sleep, look no further."
0,"Some movies are bad and worth watching 'cos they're bad, this one however is just a total stinker - no redeeming features whatsover. A total waste of time. Do not buy. Do not watch."
1,"Having read ""A Philadelphia Catholic In King James' Court"" I received a better picture of the Catholic Church. I saw how different groups view the bible, and the contradictions that become present in the Fundamentalist interpretation of the bible. I found it hard to stop reading. At some points I found myself laughing at the arguments being made by Luther and Pastor Brown. I realized that there really are people in the world who act like this. Mr. Kennedy wrote a great book that taught me a few things, and inspired me to read more about the Catholic faith. I really enjoyed the book."
1,"I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind."
0,"I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER"
0,"He just had to rush to beat Ruben to a street date, and boy can you tell it. You will be disappointed in these cookie cutter song choices. Clay can sing but I would rather have a cd of the songs he sang on the show, these are really bad. Believe an honest review and not a Clay-fanatic. There are three good songs on the cd (one being the Idol cd single This is The Night). After doing every daytime show, morning show and Jay Leno, he should sell a million copies easy. Remember a million people saw Gigli too. Buyer beware"
0,"This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
1,"Bradbury's way of writing forces you to think about how non-sensical the world is becoming. While throwing in a couple of other ideas, he builds up to describing the horrors of censorship. It seems ridiculous that the could actually become that crazy, but if we tried to make the world perfect-it would leave many people unhappy. And if we destroy books, we're destroying a person's valuable opinion containing the key to the past."
1,"Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private."
1,"Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it. Makes you think about faith while it makes you laugh about everything. If I had not read better Pratchett's books, I would have rated this with a five"
1,"George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the ""true"" narrative begins."
1,"My daughter first started reaching for this toy at about 4 months old. However, her arm control wasn't developed enough to keep her from smacking herself in the face. Not a problem with lighter toys made from softer plastic. This one is pretty hefty and I had to keep one hand on it at all times. Now, at 6 months, she's doing better and can play with it without risking a black eye.For an older baby the toy is great. I don't think she's really into the beads yet, but that will come as she grows. For now she loves the colors and shape of the toy. It's easy to grip and makes a fun sound."
0,"I'm not sure what other people are looking for in a cookbook but for a busy mom like me this cookbook wasn't ideal, most of the recipes required 10+ ingredients many of which are not commonly found in the kitchen or grocery store. If you are the type of person who has unlimited amount of time to prep and cook your meals then this book would most likely be a great addition to your library but if you're like me and have only 20 minutes TOPS to get something in the oven or on the table then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
0,"This video, like many before it, have prefered to depict the activity as quiet, restful, and meditative. This video is useful to teach beginners to classic ski provided you have an instructor doing the narration; otherwise you may just put the class to sleep.Today the consumer has MTV... Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mountain Biking) and xczone (Cross-country) films-videos to choose from.I found Cross Country Skiing by Jeff Nowak in the library. Compare with some modern titles... you be the judge."
1,"The story is wafer thin and it matters little. There is more crammed in this little unsung film than most comedies. Despite the racist undertones, Rochester shows why he was regarded as such a great comic actor. It is a pity he did not make more films as he seems the equal of Bob Hope as the scared driver of Topper.Indeed the whole film is a battle between which lunatic can hold the camera for more than a few seconds. There is just too much going on. I particularly liked Topper's wife who was so dizzy and stole scene after scene. It is a who dunnit, but that really does not matter as it is all great fun.Sit back and enjoy a piece of nonsense."
0,"I need nutrients as well as calories, protein, carbs, sodium, fiber, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and %fat calories. This book does not cover nutrients."

0,This book is the worst tutorial Illustrator book out there. It doesn't explain how or why. Not a good book for those new to Illustrator like I am.
0,"This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt."
1,"I cought the concert on some very high numbered cable channel. I was so impressed I bought the DVD. This is the most origional idea I've seen in years. Its a cross between Enigma, Petshop Boys, Alan Parsons, ELO, and a conductor on crack. The song Winter is my favorite to date. I predict you find Bond music playing in the background of TV commercials very soon. Seeing them perform is 50% of the show. Just listening will suffice if you have the memory of them performing. Download ""Winter"" or ""Duel"" to get an idea of the pure talent of BOND."
1,"This is one one of the few but great books on my bedside table. Ever since a sentimental favorite book of mine. Eversince taking up and graduating Aeronuatical Engineering in college and a flying course after, this book together with the Bible was always on my flightbag thereafter. Now I even have a copy in my office. It supplied me with inspiration and motivation. It describes the joy in fying, the drama and excitement of flight and the philosophy of the air. A wonderful book and true adventure in a paperback book to aviators and non-aviators of all ages!"
1,"Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again."
0,"Mr Drury's earlier novels are well received (Advise and Consent, particularly). I won't be bothering to read any more after this rather tedious 'The Russian's are coming to get us' effort. We all know now how that turned out. I will say that is slightly more believable than 'Red Dawn', slightly."
0,"Do not waste your time! I love hokie, I love cheese when it comes to horror. This just plain old sucked."
1,If you like Slayer then this is a must album. The drums with Dave Lombardo are once again simply perfect. The songs are very rhytmic and aggressive. The sound of the guitars and the vocals are really great. Just buy this album .
1,"I looked far and wide for a medium to light brown eyeliner pencil and this one turned out to be perfect. If you have blonde hair, you can look a little trashy wearing black eyeliner, so this is a wonderful find."
0,"This product has worked for me in the past but not this time. Not only could I smell this when plugged in, it smelled like burning plastic and made me physically ill.I used the collar with much better results, to be honest."
0,"I bought this product in April. Worked until July. Without reason, display will not respond. I called the manufacture and they said they will not fix after 90 days. Shouldn't a brand new cd player work for atleast a year before something internal breaks. I guess Memorex doesn't think so. For $[money] they said they would look at it. I told them I don't think it's a good idea to send good money after bad. I'll buy a different brand name instead."
1,"...who would have thought they could co-exist? This movie is criticized as being devoid of content, except for it's graphic sexual and violent content. I would disagree with this viewpoint. I think of it more as a study of mental illness. The film is highly unpredictable and very well made. I loved the music in the film as well. I personally didn't get the impression the filmmaker was attempting to make any broad-sweeping philosophical statements or moral pronouncements, as its critiques on this website are suggesting. Its simply a bizarre, somewhat disturbing movie that is very well made and interesting."
1,"This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart."
0,"I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."
0,I know many people swear by Pampers and I did find their fit to be very pleasing BUT both of my children had significant allergic reactions to the light scenting added to these diapers. For parents of babies with sensitive skin these may not be the diapers for you.
0,"I guess the part I liked best was where Eleanor discovered that she was related to the ghost haunting the house. It was really believable. Tears came to my eyes it was so touching. Then, when the cherubs on the wall came to life, I was even more moved as there little souls finally were freed to go to heaven. That was really touching. I am just amazed at the screenwriter's brilliance. And all those special effects! He was so clever to add those. It must of taken a great deal of intelligence to have everything--even the ceilings come alive. I feel richer as a human for investing my time in this masterpiece."
0,"I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone."
1,I bought this along with their Gold 2CD set and found Live at Wacken Open Air a little off with the sound. It could have been the placement of the microphones when it was recorded. But if you love the Scorpions you'll still enjoy this DVD.
0,"I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!"
1,I have extremely sensitive skin.Regular soaps cause me to break out in a rash.I love this product it has no harsh chemicals and is Fragrance Free.It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth not dry and irritated.I even use it on my face and I noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.If you have problem skin or sensitive painful skin I suggest you try this product I'm happy I did.
1,Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.
1,"Received from amazon within few days of ordering the product, though it was standard free super saving shipping. I'm using pampers baby dry for my elder one till he was completly potty trained. And now I have started buying baby dry for my little one who is 1 month old. Its so comfortable and keep's my babies bottom dry."
0,"After purchasing this item and getting charged about $40 AUS postage the DVD was not compatible with Australian DVD players. Conveniently you cannot return the product after it has been opened. As I could not test the DVD's compatibility until after I opened it, this return policy was no good to me. You are better off taking your chances with Ebay!!!"
1,"Perfect for the hot dog bar at my son's Mickey Mouse Carnival themed birthday party. The dogs were thoroughly cooked, and the machine itself was precious. Break down of the item allowed for easy cleaning and storing after the event. The machine is covered by a thin plastic (not fantastic quality), but it was sturdy enough to get the job done and to be expected for the price."
1,"The first story is a novella, the tale basically of a Holly Golightly type named Melba Toast who uses men for their money, and her female friend and admirer who is not sure she can or wants to become like Melba. This story and the rest of the short ones are quite different from the ones of Jaffe's usual innocent, naive heroine who has limited insight to her own behavior. The tone is more real, the women are more realistic, and the stories are just more well-written overall. I would recommend this book over any other Jaffe book."
0,"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."
0,"I really wanted to enjoy this cd, but as many times as I have listened to it......I just cant. Yes, Clay has a good voice, but I hear no emotion in it. Maybe a better choice of songs for his voice would help. I feel, in time, he will mature into a more rounded performer."
1,This book should be course-required reading for those aspiring to a career in radio. As a student studying broadcast communications this book has been invaluable at framing the industry and providing insight into the nuances of the medium. Mr McCoy has been a pioneer in the industry and has consistently inspired creativity in others... this book continues that trend.
0,"the book is simple and makes the tough parts of econometrics understandable.however some core background topics are lacking... statistical depth for persons without a solid background in statistics. such is found in other texts(see jonston, gujurati, koutsoyannis, intrilligator).furthermore the book assumes prior knowledge of matrices,hence those without a solid background herein,at left at a loss."
1,"Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German."
1,"The film is great in every way. Truly a prison ""film noir"" classic. But everytime I watch it, I always, wonder ""Six guys in a cell and no toilet."" Must have been quite a problem!"
1,"Les Annees BechetLike another reviewer, I was turned on to Sidney Bechet by Woody Allen's Paris at Midnight, which used Bechet for the opening and closing titles. I ended upbuying essentially every Bechet CD I could find on Amazon. In my judgement this one is the best not only by containing the Paris at Midnight theme but other great numbers. Bechet's September Song is truly great."
1,"Wow, this is definitely my thriller of this summer, forget Stephen King - this one will give you the creeps. Wonderful authentic and good researched - a definite page turner."
0,"Here is a book that was hailed as a best seller before it was even released. One that was fed to the public by one of America's leading talking heads, Tom Brokaw. My grandfather was at Normandy and later helped liberate several concentration camps throughout Germany. What these experiences cost him, was ultimately his life. He rarely smiled after witnessing the horrific brutality, and inhumanity that was set loose on the world in WWII and after. This book is an attempt to rewrite, an already severely inaccurate history of this period of time. Brokaw tries to take the attention from the mass slaughter that was perpetrated by BOTH sides, and instead focus on the heartwarming yet tragic human interest stories so common to todays evening news. Living through the ""greatest generation"", killed my grandfather's spirit, along with millions of others like him, who instead saw in it a living hell, and a disgrace to humanity."
1,"Of Mice and Men by John Steinback is an amazing book that combines the life of a worker and social pressure. It takes place on a ranch in the middle of nowhere. The two main characters, George and Lennie, are out to create a life for themselves. They are almost like brothers. This story has many twists and turns and makes you think about your best friend. The story creates a suprising ending. It is a great short story for someone looking for a short and good read. I recommend this to everyone. The only thing about this book making it un-acceptable would be the colorful language that John Steinback uses, but otherwise, the entire story is amazing and will never be forgotten."
0,This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.
1,"THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."

I sort of expected to receive a cruddy metal with cloth flimsily attatched, but it was bolted to the cloth, the cloth was durable and tough, the metal was the real steel, and it bent wherever I wanted it to... definately buy from this seller"
1,I have purchased three of these adapters and they work well. They will charge a G4 Powerbook while the unit is running. All 3 have worked without problem (sometimes the cord comes loose so you have to check that it is tight). No LED on the connector to indicated charging as with the original Apple adapter. Won't work on the new Intel MacBook or MacBook Pro.
1,The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.
0,"This is NOT Koss at its best. I recently bought its newest model and trashed this one. Don't bother buying it, a good price-bad deal! Buy the new one!Recommended Manufactors: Koss Aiwa Sony"
1,"I have attended Kremata Baltica's concert in Hong Kong performing exactly the same programme. I was already impressed by the performance of the enesemble for Baltica young musicians and under the direction of Gidon Kremer that night. Now the CD is still impressive. It is not easy to get impressed by contemporary music for me as an ordinary classical music lover, but Piazzolla's music is not pretending to be profound and difficult. It's new music technique does not prevent his expression and comminucation of emotions via his music to the audiences. The combination of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons & Piazzolla's The Four Seasons in Buenos Aires is a fantastic mix as well."
0,"C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about ""cutting off"" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."
1,"This book starts with Ruthie on her farm in Indiana in 1916. Ruthie is an 8 year old with long black hair and a tom boy. She lives in a family with 6 brothers.I like how Ruthie tries so hard so hard to be what her mom wants her to be a""lady"". But Ruthie Can't help it she said she needs a special doll she thinks that it will her become a lady. Its hard for cause she she has no friends and she's the only in her grade.Untill some Friends move in near her. With help from them she may be able to become one.If you want to find out what her speacil gift is you should read this book I recommend this to people who like people fighthing for their rights."
0,"I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product."
1,SOAD are so skilled and crafted in originality that they make hybrid metal and punk with a poiniant attack on politics have a new and resounding vessal.Unattainably superb the sounds this band makes are all their own. Try your best you will never begin to mistake them for another band.The title of my review only states that while being unlike thier first album this album still rocks so greatly. I myself also liked thier first album more but the highlights of this album even up and make me scream thier words in my car as I drive.I'd love to thank Serj and the boys for making such awesome and innovative music. Bless you guys!
1,"I have just recently seen Batman Begins, I would not watch it for as long as i could remember although when The Dark Night released my wife insisted on seeing it because of it being one of Mr. Ledgers (rest in peace) last films I must say he did do quite an excellent portrayal of the Joker not Jack Nicholson but for the context of the movie he was perfect I dont think anyone could have done better although my main reason for writing this review is because Batman Begins is not rated R as it is posted for the listing of this movie here on Amazon im really not sure as to who should be addressed on this but they should correct this information because it is clearly a mistake."
0,"There are numbers of opinions out there on what to do about Diabetes. DR, Barnard certainly is one of them and worth finding out about. I'm still sorting whether this is the way I should go.I think his claim that he has a ""Cure"", is hype and this discredits his main point, but I haven't dismissed it yet."
1,"I bought these as a gift, and as someone else mentioned, they are not very blue at all. They almost look white. However, they are still beautiful earrings. She loved them! The clasp is a little strange. It took me a minute to figure out how to open them. It is not a traditional clasp for earrings. This may bother some people. I don't think I would like it but my gift recipient didn't seem to mind."
1,"I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again."
0,"You can tell the difference between this and the next. A couple of good songs, nothing spectacular. One song on this CD appears on the movie ""War"" with Jet-Li. Although I rate this with an OK, Im very tough. There's no sappy love ballads, no whiney boy songs. It's in your face, and strong."
1,"I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."
0,"I bought this phone system about 6-7 months ago. I was happy with the performance, but very recently, two of the handsets failed. I thought it was a battery issue, so I replaced the batteries($30). That doesn't seem to have worked, as both of the handsets still won't take a charge. I have an older 2.4Ghz Vtech which has worked fine for the past 4-5 years, but more recent experiences with VTech have turned me off. Look elsewhere for a more reliable phone system."
1,"I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are ""different."" I never knew so many things I thought were ""wrong"" with me were commonalities to being gifted. Now that I know, I recognize it in my friends and students and I finally have a structured way to improve how I communicate and interact with ""normal"" people. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's smart and feels like they don't fit in."
0,"The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."
1,"The first in Scenario Productions' ""The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"" series and taken from the Archives of CBC Radio, this superbly presented radio adventure theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is a multicast presentation of a classic Sherlock Holmes story. This two audio cassette audio book has a two hour running time and is enhanced with music and sound effects for the perfect ""theater of the mind"" listening experience. This radio theater production of The Hound Of The Baskervilles is enthusiastically recommended for all Sherlock Holmes fans and would make a very popular addition to school and community library audio book collections."
1,"This is a handy little reference. It's about the size of a credit card, but twice as thick. Suitable for a wallet or pocket.There are six cards, double-sided, and some two knots, for a total of 15 knots. The cards are fastened together, so there's no chance you'll lose one of them.I'm just getting started learning knots, and I have tried a few of these. So far this has been a good help. This will be handy to have around. With practice, I'll have a few of these committed to memory."
0,I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
1,"I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others."
0,Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.
0,"This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book."
0,"Do not buy if using for standard, 3-pronged, U.S. home outlets. It has an additional prong on the side that made it not compatible with my room AC."
0,This case is not worth the money. The first problem was with the screw that hold the belt clip would not stay in the case. I glued that in place. Then the clip would not hold onto the case. Then the belt clip broke. The last thing was that slide that holds the Palm in the case broke. I would not recommend this case to anyone and would like to warn anyone that might want to try it. Look elsewhere!!!
0,"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
0,"I used to use the more expensive Pampers Cruisers but thought I'd try the Baby-Dry to save some money. I bought a pack at a local store first to make sure the fit and performance was good. I liked them just fine. Nice stretchy tabs, much like the Cruisers. So I ordered from Amazon. I ordered three cases to take advantage of a promotion Amazon was running. But the diapers I received must be old stock, before Pampers put the ""flex"" stretchy sides on the Baby-Dry diapers. The older expiration dates on the Rewards code confirms this. Maybe they've gotten rid of the old stock; then those newer diapers would rate 4.5 stars. These non-flex diapers barely close to fit my baby whereas the flex ones were plenty big. It irks me that Amazon posts a picture of the ""flex"" diapers and delivers a different,inferior product."
0,"I had a previous model similar to the HP 2575 which lasted for 2 years with alot of use. However, after purchasing this model on Sept 21, 2006 and using it for barely 2 months the scanner mode is now squeaking and sounds horrible. This is the same noise the prior version did right before it quit. I agree that HP support is completely worthless - that's if you can even get them to understand what your problem is since it may not be in their ""manual"".Anyone have a suggestion on a decent brand that will do incredible scans of old photos and not fail in the first two years??"
1,My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)
1,"A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a ""Mediterranean"" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichs and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la ""This Old House.""OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."
0,"The Gallagher bros. are so full of themselves that they subject their fans to this mess of rehashed 70's rock. Every tune here is about 20 minutes long- if you would dig an entire album of ""Hey Jude"" and ""You Can't Always Get..."" here it is. Oasis' lyrics have always been pretty throwaway but here they are banally Hallmark. ""All around the world/ tell 'em what ya heard"" is as deep as they get here. Check out the Unplugged bootleg to appreciate Oasis without Noel's mosquito whine voice and forget this bloated joke."

0,At your peril let your child fill one of these diapers eg during a long overnight sleep or nap... The diapers literally explode and you will find bits of soaked absorbent material all over the place. These are not as absorbent as other leading brands and when they are wet they also feel wet on the outside. I expected so much more from pampers

1,"I bought this game based off other reviews here and found it at a used game place(...). Like many of the reviews have already mentioned, this game is excellent! Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete."
0,The picture quality was terrible. I feel there was no in-studio adjustment to improve on the picture quality. Just felt cheated!
0,"I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family. I noted that some of ""his"" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself. Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was. He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being. He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc. I enjoyed the pictures."
0,"Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I haven't learned the music for Way Out in the Desert yet, so I can't speak for the tune. However, the rhythm of this counting rhyme is a lot of fun. It gets a little old by the time you get to the tenth verse, but the beat is enjoyable. If you don't like poems that sort of get you into a singsong mode, though, you might want to skip this one.The illustrations are beautiful, and terms are explained at the end of the book. If you know how to pronounce both Spanish and English words, this text is a delight to read aloud. A great introduction to desert life!"
1,The Mr Coffee - 4 cup coffeemaker arrived as promised...packaged well. It is just right for one person and fits nicely on the kitchen counter. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a couple of mugs of coffee...it brews quickly and stays hot.
0,"I was forced to watch this movie with my wife, who insisted we rent it. Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another ""Flashdance,"" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie. Nothing but T & A for the teeny bopper crowd."
1,"This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to ""Love is Like a Cigarette"" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings."
1,"I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him."
0,"I have two other cup warmers, but this was to be my third. It does EXACTLY what it claims to do: it is a cup WARMER. So, if you enjoy picking up a cup of WARM coffee -- you know -- like SPIT, 99 degress in your 98.6 degree mouth, well, good news, boppers, this is the cup warmer for you!"

0,"the perfume came without outer plastic package, as if it had been opened before :(no date of production, no detail description (like citronelol, eugenol, coumarin etc)the paper pack (the box) was deformedvery disappointing purchase. I ordered another perfume the same time from Perfumania - all the above stated points were ok."

1,"These are adequately absorbent, no offensive scents from the diaper material (before being used). Easy to use restickable tape. I have used these diapers in varying sizes since day one without any problems (except that they cannot handle all the urine of a 2 year old overnight). I never had rash problems that I can attribute to these diapers."
1,"My TiVo wireless adapter came when it was supposed to. Installed quick and easily, and in 5 minutes everything was up and running wonderfully. I love my TiVo. :)"
1,"Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too."
1,"I read this book when I was 12 years old, and it changed my life. I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12. Oh, and I was born in Brooklyn too!St. James Place"
0,"I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes, until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped. Go figure with the poorly made stitching. I've never had a pear of shoes last only one day. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these. 365 times longer than these shoes. WTF"
1,"This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music. A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. Such, direct and bold songs as ""I Think I'm Paranoid"", ""Pust It"", and ""When I Grow Up"" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive!"
1,The whole album is amazing and hyper ballad has got to be one of the most beautiful songs ever.
0,"This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics.For instance, Sunshowers:""You wanna win a war? Like PLO I don't surrender""""It's a bomb yo, so run yo, put away your stupid gun yo... that's why we blow it up before we go""""they showed him a picture then, ain't that you with the muslims?""Now I'm not one for censorship, but I can't back someone glorifying PLO and terrorism in dance music. That's just ridiculous. I know reggae has roots of being somewhat violent and rebellious back at its early roots, but I absolutely can't sponsor these messages. It's just wrong."
0,"Ok this stuff is terrible. These reviews have to be fake. Like other reviewers have noted, because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick, it makes it completely useless. Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big. You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful. I'm having much better success with it. You get what you pay for."
0,"I just wanted to point out that a lot of these reviews are fake, probably from the publisher. How do I know this? Because people from Laguna Beach, California do not spell favorite like ""favourite"". Try harder next time publisher."
0,The seal was broken and some of the product had been used. Because I was afraid to use it I tossed it out.
1,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
1,this movie when i saw it in the theaters was a very good movie. I believe if you liked the first one you'll like this one even better.. worth getting. I'll be getting it soon myself when I get the money to do so.
0,"This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund."
0,"this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
0,"The kit I received is not the one in the picture, it says it should fit a 99 civic, but does not even come close. The instructions are EXTREMELY vague and do not provide any clarity at all as to what brackets to remove or use. IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT!!! I attempted to contact customer service and i got what sounded like a crappy home answering machine. Now I have a disassembled car with no radio and no way to mount it. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN! Do yourself a favor and find another mounting kit if you have a 99 civic, this is not a mounting kit for a 99 civic. Such a scam."
0,"I bought the Mega Playland for my seventeen-month old son this past Christmas. I bought it on sale for $40 after reading mixed reviews. Sure enough - upon opening I found that every piece had a couple of four-five inch spans of seam that weren't sewn. After spending an hour with my needle and thread (on Christmas morning) it was ready to go. My son likes it. Our 100 pound dog likes it too, and it seems to be holding up fine so far."
1,This book is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader. I laughed out loud while reading because Ms Smith uses comical pharses I have grown up hearing. This is an awesome book.
0,"I can`t tell you how disappointed i was when i bought this album back in 1982. Since then the musical landscape has changed a bit but it`s still pretty bad in my opinion . Worst tunes are Staying power, action this day, Body language. Some songs are quite agreeable like Back Chat (sounds a bit like Diana Ross`s ""upside down"")""Las Palabras"" is a nice ballad Under Pressure is still a great number which was originally written for the Greatest Hits album(1981) and therefore it sounds like a stranger on this record."
1,"Well written, superbly cast, well acted, good ending -- a thinking Brit's thriller with newspaper reporters and editors as the heroes."
1,The Zajirushi NS-ZCC10 rice cooker really does turn cheap and unappetizing rice into something delicious. I tested it with a batch of old cheap rice that was sitting in the cabinet (and with good reason) and it remarkably transformed the taste. The rice raw had that familiar unappealing smell to it that reflected its poor taste but after being cooked with this rice cooker there was no trace of it. Excellent product.
1,"This book is very good, interesting, and helpful I recommend this book to those who love and live under the moon."
1,He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
1,"'First Under the Wire' is a very consistent and pleasing record. Assuming you like the LRB sound (I do, very much -- but they inspire loathing in some, a mystery to me unless those people hate melody, killer harmonies, and strong songwriting). I find it to be essentially a reworking of their previous album 'Sleepercatcher', with lots of 'matching' tracks. Cool Change=Sanity's Side, The Rumor=Shut Down Turn Off, Middle Man=Light of Day etc. That's not a problem for me though, because I love Sleepercatcher. I have to take issue with the reviewer who panned Mistress Of Mine, though... I think it's one of Glenn Shorrock's finest moments.Definitely one of LRB's high points."
0,"This book was the most boring book I have ever read. There was no point to the whole book, because all he talked about was his accomplishments and things that other people wrote about him. This book has no suspenseful or interesting parts in it. I feel that no one could ever like this book."
0,"I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs, and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed."
0,"Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950""s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. ""Cold Sassy Tree"" comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."
1,"This is not your average kid's tape! Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!"
1,"I thought this was a great movie. Fine, so the story was average, but the fantastic effects and even better sound more than made up for it. I would recommend this film to anyone with a dolby digital setup, just sit back and feel the room shake!"
1,"Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas."
0,Rating **Michel Cane Frank I believe that he was a pathetic actor and he really looked like he was just doing it for money. They should have probably chosen a better person to play it. I give Michel a 3 for his acting. Julie Walters Rita I believe that she played a good role in her person and she fitted it really well. Julie I give here a 10 for her acting. Well because Frank Michel was suck a bad actor I believe that there is no two incidents that I want to discuss but instead of Frank going to Australia by him self he should of gone to Australia with Rita. So the ending really sucked. I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 because I did not really get into the movie.
1,"For these reviews, I like to know what I'm getting. Here are the episodes- Simpsons Haloween Special, Bart Gets An F, Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish, Bart VS. Thanksgiving, Bart the Daredevil, and my personal favorite, Marge VS. Itchy and Scratchy. If I were you, I'd go for Wave three. But these are also wonderfully ""delicious"" episodes."
1,The authors have provided the quintessential study guide to The Canterbury Tales. This book is invaluable.
1,"Finnaly the Black Crowes are back to what they are doing best-dirty,bluesy rock & roll. Probably the most Black Crowes's fans(including myself) were wondering whether they will produce an album to match the level set by their first two projects. Yes, The Black Crowes delivered it. It is a huge enjoyment to listen ""By Your Side"". WELL DONE BOYS! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE YOU ON STAGE."
0,"Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies . I will keep the first Transformers movie and forget about the others that followed."
0,"This product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the book. I was disappointed with this since I wanted a new version of this book."
1,This is was a small market movie (saw it in the theater; have not yet listend to the blu-ray so this is not a completely fair review of the actual product; though I did purchase it). Think garden state (though the story is very different). 100% recommended heart warming story.
1,"Trevor does an execptional job of captivating the reader and telling the story from the two main characters (Felicia and Hilditch). One cannot help but feel sad after reading this novel. All involved appear to be victims at various times and on various levels. Felicia, the victim of death (her mothers) and a jilted lover and Hilditch. Hilditch a victim of his mother and his need for ""friendship"".Trevor will keep you reading and feeling throughout the book. Do not expect to feel good after reading this novel. A great book for a book group discussion."
1,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Sonoma. I was pleasantly shocked! I couldn't believe how many crazy things were happening, and it just kept getting crazier and crazier. From the beginning of the movie there is no way to prepare for the turn that the movie takes. The situations that the obsessed Moz fan gets herself into are both hilarious and disturbing. And all the supporting characters were wacky too. What kind of twisted mind made this flick? While it didn't leave me feeling warm and fuzzy, it definitely left me with a smile."
1,"This was the second book I read by Terry. Since then, I've loved Discworld books about Ankh-Morpork (and especially the night watch). To get the full effect, read Feet of Clay, then Jingo right after this one."
0,"I suspect if you're a Garwood fan you will enjoy this novel. To me, her novels are all too similar. With Ransom, she takes the reader yet again into the highlands with a bit of mystery, adventure, clan-loyalty, and romance. Actually, the romance aspect is debatable b/c attraction is NOT romance as far as I'm concerned.Garwood's characters are all the same, she merely changes their names in each of her books. I'm not saying they are dislikable, just redundant. Other reviewers boast this is Garwood's best highlander romance; if this is true, I am not interested in reading any others. It wasn't awful, it was just the same old stuff."
1,"His forecast (in 1948) that over-efficiency of machines would eventually undo supply and demand economics came true in Fall 2008 when it suddenly became apparent there are too many car companies producing too many cars. With not enough wars to take up the slack every manufacturing job is now under threat. In Oceania FEAR of competing economies (and terrorists) paralyses the confidence and asperations of the middle-class (the Outer Party).None of which concerns members of the Inner Party. Not as once surmized politicians or dictators but the BANKING ELITE. As faceless bankers can make or break the fortunes of billions of proles around the globe it is they who have assumed the mantle of unlimited uncontrollable POWER.Can there now be any doubt, with the disintegration of General Motors, his prognosis that machines would lead to social unrest rather than increase communal wealth was finally proven 100% correct - 60 years later - in 2008?"
1,Winteriziing your RV can be a challenge at times depending on HOW you do it.I find it best to open all of the valves and blow all of the lines out. I still use a little antifreeze as a precaution.
1,"this would be a good time for america to wake up and embrace this tremendously talented singer. how this woman is not as successful in the usa as she is in europe is beyond me. so many great songs here. from the dance/pop/r+b of her first two albums, to the rock influenced hits from her third album. this is a great way to catch up if you've missed out on anastacia.also includes ""everything burns"" with ben moody from evanesence and her gorgeous duet with italian superstar eros romazotti, ""i belong to you"""
0,"I'm sorry I ever purchased this movie. Eddie Rickenbacker must be rolling over in his grave. Absolutely no relationship to reality. An insipid story line and unrealistic special effects. If you want a good WWI movie, go with All Quiet on the Western Front (with Lew Ayers) or the Blue Max (with George Peppard). Forget this drival."
0,"The product did what it was ""supposed to"" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."
1,"I don't really enjoy reading gory books, but this was an exception. It is a pretty good book with tales of a brave hero. I just wish that Beowulf didn't seem so perfect. Unferth had a horrible death and I wish that he didn't. The book would be much better if Unferth lived and plotted evil agains beowulf"
0,"1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album."
1,"I feel that this, and Morning Glory (the CD that Oasis put out before this one) are the best CDs for those new to Oasis.Why? This is the last CD Oasis made with the core of the original band.Also, Noel is writing very long dreamy heavy rock songs and rock ballads that are well-crafted, yet that go nowhere and in circles but just enjoy doing that, cause that's what it's all about anyway, ehs? Noel's guitarwork is all over the sonic screen, and Liam sounds great, too.A great, long album not unlike all the double-LP rock albums of the Seventies that had vague concepts and heavy chording.Get it."
1,"Best diapers ever! Believe me, with my two kids I tried a lot! Good leakage protection, thin (what is very good for summer)."
1,I love the way this was written. I could just picture a no nonsense pioneer housewife. Not everything would pertain to the modern day but still very good.
1,You've probably already read opinions on the ESV translation. I generally find it to be pretty good but a little harder to read than NIV.My main comment is about the actual quality of this Bible. The printer probably needs to take a look at the paper trimmer for their printing press. Several pages were not trimmed properly. Instead they were folded into the book. I had to take some scissors and trim the pages properly..I know that isn't a big deal but you might care if you're getting this as a gift for someone else...Best Regards....
1,I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD
0,Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!
1,"Got this as a free Kindle read and so glad I did. This was one you did not want to put down and felt as if you were there in the scene, as you were drawn into the story. I liked that it was not repetative, as some writers will repeat points already made. The story was fast moving, engaging, and certainly of interest. A true test of any good book is if you want to read the next in the series and I'm there."
1,"Orwell tells a story about Winston Smith, a man living in the utopian world of 1984! The book deals with his struggles, and eventually, the story's end is so depressing that in the end, you may want to commit suicide or take up liquor. BEWARE"
0,"I just heard this CD my friend was going crazy over the guy on Worship Christ. She says that she saw them perform this some years ago and he was awesome (better than Kirk, Deitrick etc) She says he was doing all the Michael Jackson and daincing stuff but in a unique way before all of them. I admit Worship Christ is awesome his flow is off the meter. I also like New direction the title song but the flow is weak and sounds like a bootleg gangsta rapper trying to be church. I don't know who the guy is but he is wet. I know it is church but I am not really into church. But Worship christ made me wanna get more into church music. If anybody knows who that guy is or if he has more music out let me know. His name isnt on the CD but I think they call him Mr Kas or Cash or something like that."
1,Loved the movie. Actually like to watch anything with Drew in it.So adorable. Anyway I would like to know which island most of the movie was filmed on. I would guess Maui but don't really know.
0,"Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode."
1,"almost all brand diapers we tried,this is the best,good price,over night protection,'soft,no red rash ever.love this product,will come againand the 30%off is great deal"
1,"Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice."
1,"More accessible than some of his others, this book nevertheless exhibits the same pyrotechnic, questing intelligence that makes everything from his hand a delight to read. Excellent translation maintains a high order language as thrilling as it is conceptually sophisticated. The argument is not an academic one; rather, this is speculative writing at its most adventurous. A title for those who consider the brain their favorite organ."
0,"Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film."
1,"Fast Orange, at the best price, buy 2 and get free shipping, a great deal. Need I say more?"

1,All works are untampered with and represents truth based reading as to the authenticity. Nice bound book to boot as with elder tradition.
0,"A friend of mine gave the ""Sammy and Sharon Safety"" product to my son as a gift. My son tried to open it, but struggled mightily with the packaging. After a few frustrating minutes, I took it away from him and tried to open it myself. It was amazingly difficult, espcially considering the age group that this product is intended for. What was even more disturbing was that in my own frustration to open the box, I cut my finger open on the plastic! Thank goodness it wasn't my son's finger! If it wasn't so disturbing I would have laughed at the irony that I was injured by a toy supposedly promoting safety.All of this preceded our discovery that the product as a whole is quite poorly made (the outfit is already falling apart). In addition, it seems that the author of the book is so concerned with rhyming that he ignores basic principles of grammar and sentence structure. Children's books should not seem as if they were written BY children."
1,Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving.
1,"I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy."
0,"We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!"
1,"I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her. I also thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Not really the way I would have ended the series. (to my knowledge, it was the last)"
0,"While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."
1,"This movie is based loosely on the true story of France Mayes. It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery. All of the characters are perfect!I also stumbled on to a daily planner based on the story... filled with gorgeous pics and quotes, stories, and recipes from Frances. So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!"
1,"Ray Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451 is actually a pretty good book. I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother."
0,"i thankfully got this cd for christmas, so i did not have to waste my money on it, i liked ""tubthumping"" at the time. i had no idea about what a dissapiontment it would be. it's sounds too kinda ""un-musical"" i have no idea where they got some of those sounds from, but it's nothing that should be used it hte future. i have had this album for a whole year and still havn't listned to the whole thing.so, sample the rest of the somgs on a cd before you put it on your christmas wish-list!!!"
0,"This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it. This was a week ago, and as I see they still advertise the Saris with anti-sways and rubber hold down straps. BEWARE of this company!!!!"
1,"I love everything about the Saris Bones--especially the bright red that matches my car!--except the metal clamps that clip onto the trunk at 6 points. There's bound to be a better way to keep them from scratching the paint than my solution of wrapping them in Saran Wrap. Otherwise, it's easy to mount, holds the bikes securely, and did i mention it matches my car perfectly?"
0,I ordered the ear gels to go with my Jawbone Bluetooth headset. The problem that I see is that the ear gels are too bulky when combined with the Jawbone.
0,"This was not a very good movie. I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.Anybody want to buy a slightly used copy?"
0,"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,This is a very fascinating book that lets you see inside the minds of five unique characters (plus Swan herself). It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring! The characters are written with excellent detail and realism and the story has lots of twists and turns. Impossible to put down!
1,"I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9"" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes..."
1,"This is one of the most touching books I have ever read! I won't say why, though, because that would ruin it if you haven't read it. If you have read it, you know exactly what I mean. This book is brilliant. DO NOT read the ending before you've read the rest of the book!!!"
0,"This movie, supposedly a journey into terror, lulls one off to sleep most of the time. The pace is so slow that I thought the exposition would never end. There wasn't one fear producing moment in the entire movie. I believe ""Bambi"" was scarier.This movie is dreadful, especially when one remembers the 1963 version with Julie Harris. I wonder how much money was spent making this dud!"
0,"I was disaapointed with the content of the book. I was hoping for something that was much more cutting edge, not just the basic mainstream medical community approach. While it is great to see all of the hormones discussed, it didn't go far enough for me."
0,"This is an historic film version, but the print I just purchased from Amazon is of very poor quality. If you go to Netflix, a much better print can be viewed streaming (and it's free to Netflix subscribers). This version for sale on Amazon should be retired. Amazon, please do something!"

1,Aside from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan novels no other book has captured my imagination like John Carter has. I'm not much of a book reader and loved all of the Tarzan novels and have every one of them in origianl print and since I have read A princess of Mars I am looking forward to purchasing the whole Barsoom series and cannot wait to read them all.
0,"Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"
0,"I absolutely love Clay's voice, and I couldn't wait for the release of this disappointing debut. But the nuances of his voice that make it so phenomenal are hidden underneath the ""music."" I would rather hear Clay singing acappella or singing just about anything other than these songs. Why cover up such a beautiful voice?"
1,I first read this when I was in 8th grade and probably rushed through it. 15 years later I decided to read it again -- even the first few pages are wonderful.
1,"This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 ""I Need A Hot Girl"", ""We On Fire"", ""Respect My Mind"" & ""Tuesday & Thursday"". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? ""Ridin'"" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like ""Clear Tha Set"" by Lil'Wayne. ""Ya Dig"" by Juvenile. ""Help"" by B.G., and ""Bout Whatever"" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. ""Too Hot"" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!"
1,"This is an excellent book, which used to be the basis for the League of American Wheelmen (now the League of American Bicyclist's) safe cycling class (at the time known as Effective cycling. Learn all the critical skills for riding safely in traffic, including such things as emergency stops and emergency turns (i.e. when a car ""hooks"" you by making a right turn in front of you).This book has been around for a long time, restructured and revised in this 6th edition, it's a much better read -- I just wish John could give up on his political ranting (correct as much of it is) and spend some time on riding safely in the world of bike lanes, etc. rather than wishing they didn't exist -- sadly, given legislative ignorance such things are here to stay and every cyclist should know how to use them safely!"
0,"When I bought this book I was hoping on getting a book covering only small jets! But what I got was a book including a lot of piston aircraft and a few airliners along with the biz JETS. Piston engine isn't a jet engine! Some informations that I would like to know on these ""jets"" are not there e.g. cruising alt. But the book has it's good sides to! The recognition part is very neat and I the thing that gives this book those two stars!"
1,"I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided."
0,"Okay, this movie may not be nominated for an Oscar for best Movie, or best acting, or not even for FX. However, it is a good movie where you can spend 108 minutes. The critics listed above were too harsh, and I almost did not buy the movie. I am glad I did, and will watch it a few more times. Zeta-Jones is a pretty girl, she has nice outfits in the movie. The haunted hause is nicely decorated, so why not watch it a few more times. Please keep in mind, sometimes movies are for a good pass-time, and this one is one of those."
1,"This killer box set covers most of Basie's best in studio work from 1936 to 1945 when he had the best band around, bar none. We are talking about some of the very best jazz musicians of all time: Lester Young, Herschel Evans, Buck Clayton, Don Byas, Sweets Edison and the monster rhythm section of Freddy Green, Walter Page and Jo Jones. Of course the Count himself was no slouch on the piano and add the vocals of Jimmy Rushing and Helen Humes and you've got 4 discs of music you can listen to over and over again without it ever growing stale. There is simply not a less than very good song in the lot. JSP once again does a fine remastering job. Even if you have the 3 disc Complete Decca set, much of which is included here, it's still well worth it to get this one too."
0,I ordered these after my baby grew out of Swaddlers which don't come in a size 4. Swaddlers were amazing! These are terrible. She leaked with every poop and had to be changed many more times during the day. I changed to cruisers and am once again happy with Pampers. I would definitely recommend cruisers!
0,"As others have commented, the dreary humdrum of ""Last Days"" feels more authentic (and sad) than a typical Hollywood rendering of the same. I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real. But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists. In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care. In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them). When the end came, I just didn't care anymore. If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy. It was a blessing.Postscript: it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho. Those folks . . . just let them die. We don't need them here."

1,"This is the classic jazz Christmas Album--from before there were dozens of copy-cat collections. I nearly wore out the vinyl, and its yet to be CD'd companion, ""More Sounds of Christmas"". 'Merry Chirstmas Baby' is sooo cool jazz. If you love jazz and dig the Christmas sounds, then this is a MUST."
0,"I just received this today and while I knew to expect nothing hand crafted, I was shocked at how amazingly flimsy this thing really is. The bottom wood actually came with a huge crack; big enough to leak out all the sand. The feet were glued on with cheap glue and 3 of the 4 came off in transit. Based on the construction, I'm amazed it was even in one piece.The reason this gets 2 stars is that the accessories are pretty decent. And the sand looks fine. If this wasn't cracked in the center, I'd most likely have kept it and it would have ""worked"" for its purpose. Having said that, if you are looking for a desktop zen garden, look elsewhere."
1,"Forget what the naysayers reviewed. It brought me back to my childhood. I thought it had a good enough plot. Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago. Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek. And what were you expecting Shindler's List? L.A. Confidential? The first time you saw Sixth Sense? It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it."
1,Booker T. Washington tells his story in a compelling way that he never could have guessed would have affected the future generations in this way. This is a book that will put things in perspective and it contains a lot of life lessons. While in many ways we have moved forward as a country there are so many mindsets that are exactly the same as what is stated in the pages of 'Up from Slavery'. Read this book and then think about how you live your life. You won't be the same.

0,"Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called ""Clay nation"" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"
1,"I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often. However, I loved it as a movie, not necessarily as an adaptation of The Odyssey, which is one of my favorite books."

0,"My Dad bought a Tivo for my Mom for Christmas, and we were all very excited about it. However, eventhough it was easy to hook up, as soon as it was it started conflicting with our HD channels and it messed up our sound. Also, it goes on rampages taping shows at random and quickly filling up the given 80 hrs. I figured the sound problem was probably just loose audio wires which I checked time and time again. I called the tech support where I waited on hold for almost an hour then they told me that sometimes the audio feed would fragment and they offered to replace the Tivo if I shipped it back in its original box... More effort than its worth.. Should've gotten the Charter DVR. I dont recommend this product if you have a cable box."

The thrilling tales of battle, adventure, and love on the red planet are just as great as I remembered them. John Carter is a fantastic hero and his name should be right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, Drizzt D'ourdan, and Han Solo.A Princess of Mars"
1,"The few Victorian references only add to the charm of these books. They are very well written adventures, from an imaginative author, writing when automobiles had just come out. I won't repeat what the other reviewers say, except that you can go back and enjoy these every few years. The recent movie seemed to mix several of the books together, and didn't do this set justice. I think the series is actually better than the Tarzan series."
1,"Been using this printer for about 6 months and love it. Got tired of replacing the color ink cartriges in inkjet printers to make them print monochrome. This printer is a lot faster than inkjets anyway, both warmup and print speed. Ink cost works out just over 3 cents a copy using HP toner cartriges. Had no trouble setting up on XP desktop."

1,"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."
0,This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.
0,"I purchased the Pampers Baby-Dry because it advertised that it would keep baby dry for up to 12 hours - it didn't keep her dry for even a 3 hour nap. For an entire week, every single time she would wake up wet - her clothes were wet, her bed was wet, we had to change the sheets twice a day and her clothes even more. It was a disaster. We went back to using Huggies, even though they were more expensive. The time and energy we took laundering and changing everything made the price for Huggies worth it and we haven't had a problem since we switched back to Huggies."
1,"I have read bad reviews of this product and I think the expectations weren't reasonable!What this warmer does is give me back the bottom inch of my coffee, which I've never finished because I can't stand lukewarm coffee. The top half is always piping hot, but I suck that down right away anyway. This warmer keeps the bottom of my mug ready to drink when I get to it.I got jewelry for Christmas and I love it, but this is the best gift that will truly keep on giving.If you want your full drink to stay piping hot for any time, I suggest don't pour it til you're ready to drink! If you want a place to set your coffee that will keep you sipping hot coffee to the bottom, this is your product!!!!!"
1,"By far- i must say, this must be one of the best movies during its time with an all black cast. The enterntain was great, but it had a creative storyline that went right along with what was going on in the film."
1,"I've tried several different wired and wireless adapters for the TiVo. This one is the easiest to set up. You just plug it in and it's ready. The connection is well built, not flimsy like several other adapters I've tried."
1,"I recently ordered this same CD as a gift for my wife. She loved it so much that she asked me to order another one as a going-away gift for a close friend, who was leaving the state. The friend loved it as well. If you love Beethoven, you can't go wrong buying this CD. I cannot think of anyone who plays his piano concertos any better."
0,"This ""Mug Warmer"" does exactly what it promises. It warms the mug. Not the coffee. The plate never got hot enough to keep my coffee sufficiently warm."

0,"A woman (with a child in a state of perpetual tantrum) straps a camera to a stroller to see who will help her carry it. This is a video about how one person's poor planning can become everyone's problem! I looked for the story in it, but couldn't find one, so I shut it off."

0,Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
1,"The book begins with Lennie and George: Lennie being an oversized mamoth of a man--Goliath--in a way, and George being your man of an average size. The roll between the two is that they both have the same dream and that is to live off the fat of the land and raise rabbits. Lennie, is best put as retarded, but is really the nicest guy in the world: it is just his size that interfears with the two men's lives. George has a short fussed temper and Lennie can't help but be dumb when it comes to any situation they may find themsleves in. The book has a great plot that you have to stop and think about long after you have put the book down, and this is without a doubt, the most realistic novel I have ever read. I would suggest reading this at a MATURE high school level. If you are too young for this book, you will not understand it. If you do understand it, you will see what a great novel it really is."
0,"This could be a really great item. The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer. The material is not bulky and stays static free. The fit is comfortable enough that I don't notice I'm wearing it under a dress. I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying: the adjustable straps don't stay put. I have to adjust them every time I wash it (where they also become very twisted), every time I put it on or take it off. The straps slip throughout the day as I wear it... you get the idea. The annoyance this poses to me outweighs the other good features that it has. I will ditch it after this winter, unfortunately. If readjusting does not bother you, than there is nothing else wrong with this item."
0,"Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."
1,"Este libro ha sido uno de los mejores libros que he leido, soy adicta a la lectura y este libro me ayudo en muchas formas. Te ensena a analizar muchas cosas, a comprender otras con respecto a la vida y te lleva a tener una mente mas abierta cuando por ejemplo te pone a dudar si hay mas vidas ya que en algunas religiones eso es inconcebible.This book is one of the best books I have ever read, It makes you think and wonder about past life especially if you do not believe in that. I truly recommend this book."
1,"This is a wonderful second chapter to the Narnia series. The choice of actors is excellent and the CGI mixed with the live action is completely cool. This is one of the few fantasy movies that makes for beleivable looking characters out of the non-human races. The first movie was great and followed the orignal story so well, and the follow-up did not fail in its mission either. The children have grown as have their characters and it is wonderful. The story from begining to end is intrigueing and again, follows C.S.Lewis' story so well, that I would defintly tell anyone to get this for their collection. A wonderful movie for anyone of any age."
0,"Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space. The repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable - I felt like I had read the same chapter a dozen times. Read the Cliff Notes, save yourself some time. *****"
0,Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game.
1,"This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time."
1,i got this for my son who wants to go to china. he is pleased and is starting to speak a little of the language already. good book.

1,"Got this so I could start performing again(drag queen)and have put on a few pounds around the mid area, I didn't want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy. Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits, Works great and like they say pain is beauty, and this is so worth it."
1,The Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump is a amazing purchase comparing price and quality.
0,"Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?"
0,"A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book."
1,"I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!"
1,"This album is incredible! It has been too, too long since an album has been made that is packed with all #1 hits. Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man will revolutionize the music industry. His pure, amazing voice is brethtaking. This album is a definite MUST for all Music Lovers of all ages."
1,"You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water, as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line. The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle. After a few minutes, you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card, which gives you your nitrite level. It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point."
0,"Robocop 3(1993) was the last nail in the coffin for the Robocop film franchise. B movie director Fred Dekker tones down the violence and adds a lot of campy humor into the film so it can get a PG-13 rating. Peter Weller bailed from the series and Robert John Burke was cast as Robocop! Officer Lewis(Nancy Allen) is tragically killed off by an evil OCP officer! Robocop takes sides with people who are being kicked out of their homes by OCP so they can build Delta City over Old Detroit. The film is even more camped up by throwing a robo-ninja into the movie! Basil Poledouris returned to give us a real Robocop music score. Robocop 3 is a mish-mash of serious drama and campy comedy. Robocop ""borrows"" a pimp's car to chase bad guys! Even with the best of intentions, Robocop 3 was still a failure."
0,"At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!"
1,"I can't get enough of this CD. I play it every day, many times a day. I hear the next single will be ""The Way"" with ""Solitaire"" on the B-side, both perfect choices. Clay's voice gets more unbelievably beautiful every time I hear him. I was worried about this CD catering more to what passes for popular music today, but, thankfully every track is a gem and remains true to Clay himself and his fans. My favorites are No More Sad Song, The Way, I Will Carry You, Run to Me, but it's really hard to pick favorites because they are all so good. I simply cannot wait for a brand new full CD of Clay. He and his voice are a winner in every sense of the word...and don't forget he just won American Music Award's Fans' Choice and a Billboard award for his single, This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Waters. As Diane Sawyer said, ""He's on a rocket to the stars!"""
0,"Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!"
1,"I have several photography books that I have had no desire to read from cover to cover. Then I found this one! This is by far the best photography book that I have laid my eyes on. I am reading it cover to cover and plan on reading it again. John Garret has written it in such a fun, simple way that really makes you understand photography. I've even learned more from this book than I have in a photography class that I have taken.If you are just getting started in your photography adventure, I highly recommend this book!"
0,"I can't believe this is the book my advanced calc 1 class used at university. They sold it to me for $114.50+tax! This is a deal here. This class was the hardest class I took for undergrad. The book was no help. I learned everything I knew from the teacher and from the Internet/study groups. I do like how organized the book is, but the information was impossible for me to learn from the book."
0,"I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually."
1,"Although the quality of the DVD left a bit to be desired, the memories it brought back were fantastic. I had thought those old moments were never to be seen again, but viewing this DVD allowed me to relive them."
0,lene is probobly a very upbeat and interesting person but the book is choppy and doesn't grip you like some other books.if you have all the other everest books go ahead and get it but you'll enjoy 'high exposure by breashears and climb by anatoli b. much better
1,"If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, regardless of your gender, you will enjoy this film. There's something in it for everyone, it's not just a ""chick flick"". Drew and Adam are superb and the story is unique and captivating - especially for a comedy. And it's a great date film. Show your date you actually have a sense of humor and see this movie together!"
1,"With no background in soccer, I was at a loss, and as a new soccer player, so was my son. I took advantage of the ""Parent Soccer Coach"" DVD as a tool for our family's mutual ""Soccer Education"". My son enjoyed watching the DVD and used it to reinforce what he was learning on his team. He also seemed to get a lot of self-affirmation from the DVD by pointing out his knowledge & skills.This DVD offers an easy & convenient way to build awareness of soccer for the entire family."
1,"For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it."
1,"This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf."
0,"This game, although somewhat fun, is very limited in its capacity. The only way that the game is able to guess the item about which you are thinking, is if you choose something (an object, etc.) that is very simple, and that you can describe with great accuracy. Otherwise, the game guesses your thoughts incorrectly most of the time. It is not very sophisticated, and is truly not worth the money. In other words, do not buy this product."
1,"It's no Dark Knight, but then again, what is...anyway, still better than all the ""original"" Batman movies. At least the quality of the video is great."
0,"I was so disappointed in this movie. The plot sounded great, the cast was certainly good, but after twenty minutes and several songs later I wanted to turn it off. I didn't because I thought it might improve. I was wrong. I have never written a review but this one was so bad I feel I have to."
1,Amazing book. I've never read one like it. Quite interesting. Honest experiences. An eye-opener. Anyone interested in history will enjoy this. I am.

It's the one with Keith Richards in it.THIS IS NOT A NEW DVD.If you enlarge the photo you can see that someone cut and pasted the WRONG people at their instruments.

0,"In this classic novel, John Steibeck tells the story of two friends in 1930s California. George and Lennie are Itinerant farm workers.They work for making their dream come true, having a farm of their own with animals, etc.The story develops in a farm, where we know many characters, all of them, have dreams.The main theme on the story is dream, But also violence and loneliness are important. All of the characters, are, in extreme situations, where the only salvation is work, and dream. I did not like so much the book,I find it a bit dense, but the story, theme, and how the story is tell, makes the book, a good book, only suitable for Steinbeck's fans."

0,"There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2 had none. Waste of time."
0,This could have been a good book but the writer puts in child rape which is gross and doesn't have the couple together enough. Teh war is used to take up space and the romance with the slave couple was more believable. Not enough passion and does not cover the war very well
0,"I bought this as a gift for my husband, and he is so disappointed that I didn't choose something of higher quality. I read all the reviews and thought it sounded like a good first mp3 player that he could use to work out. At first, I couldn't download his music onto it at all, which turned out to be a simple thing: there is a button on the side that locks the player, which is not mentioned in the enclosed guide. The headphones started to cut out within a day, and if you wiggle the wires it goes in and out. The control buttons are loose and move in different directions, sometimes getting caught under each other. After 2 uses, it quit, and only works randomly. I am returning the product and will go for a real ipod next time. (We also use itunes, and it has been a pain to transfer our music to another program.)"
0,"I have had a white one for years and very happy with it. However, I purchased two new mugs that were larger on the bottom than my other mugs.

0,"I had to read this for school. The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class. Montag's wife was annoying to me and Bradbury's ideas are really intersting. Too bad he can't write his way out of a paper bag. This book was a waste of time. Never read it unless its required and theres a test on it. Then you could make an exception, I guess."
1,"I was looking to hook my computer up in our kitchen/dinning room and wanted the option of watching TV when not on the computer. This monitor works perfect. We do not have it hooked up to a HD broadcast, so it looks better from about 4 feet away than right up next to it. But either way it still looks good. I love surfing the internet and watching the basketball game in the PIP. We don't haver it hooked up to a stereo and use the TV speakers and it sounds GREAT! It has a lot of set up options to get the picture looking its best. And the remote has gread functions and is easy to use.The monitor, itself, looks great. We always get great compliments from our friends!"

It is absolutely amazing and please don't listen to the remnants of Ruben's fans who are rating Clay badly because they are still disappointed that ""their"" hero will go nowhere.Every song is outstanding, just as Clay is and it is overwhelming that he can do so fantastic on so many songs in such a short time. Keep up the good work Clay and millions are rooting and supporting you. Was at the Houston and Dallas tour and the experience will be remembered a lifetime. Alainapoo"
0,This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one.
1,"This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the ""truth"" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."
0,"I absolutly hated this book, It not only bored me but it aggervated me to the fullest. It wasn't realistic and the things that happen in the book were just stupid! Not to mention the main character's wife was just a moron, and who wants to burn books? I mean thats alittle odd, burning down houses because people owned books, ahhhhhhh, not a good book"
0,"Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."

0,"Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
1,"I've watched the show for years and thought I knew a lot about it, but this book took me backstage and behind the scenes in such cool detail I quickly realized how much more there was to the story of this show. These guys managed to make all the years of the show entertaining and revealing, and I really liked the fact that I could pick up the book, turn to any page, and find a great story to jump from. Probably the best book on a TV show I've ever read."
0,This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book.

0,"If you ask me, any movie that is based on a video game and they don't have similar story lines is a lame attempt at a movie. Lets take a look at the games, it doesn't take place in a city, iggy and spike are dinosaurs, Yoshi is not a pet to koopa, koopa's are turtle like creatures, Luigi has a moustache, and the maidens name is peach. In the movie, Mario and Luigi have to jump by using air stompers, the maiden's name is Daisy, Goomba's are humanoid in appearance, Koopa Troopa's drive around in cars, and there is no Bowser, just Koopa. I could go on for hours, but if you are a Mario fan, don't see this movie, STAY AWAY!!!"
0,"I am writing this review without having even seen the movie itself, for the shock I got as I received this product was enough. I got the dvd, and the first thing that hit me was that the cover did not fit on the box well.. why? because it was printed on a home printer, and when I opened it, the product itself apparently was burned at home as well. Basically, I paid for an original movie and got a bootleg."
0,"Until now, there was some debate aboutPlan 9 from Outer Spacebeing the worst movie ever made. Well, the debate is over...The Descent (Unrated Widescreen Edition)wins that prize hands down! There's definitely something wrong with a movie when you find yourself rooting for the monsters more than the victims. And how come all the monsters look like mindless male brutes? Hmmm...Thank goodnes for the FAST FORWARD button, and even more thanks for the STOP button. Now, if I can just find the FORGET button!"
1,"If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."
1,I ordered this book for school and expected to get the book within a few weeks. I received the book less than a week later! The book was in the same condition that was listed. I would recommend this seller to anyone needing textbooks at a good price.

0,This had no impact whatsoever on my warts. I was concerned that one of my children would think it was lip balm and accidentally use it on their lips...this didn't happen but I even if it had it certainly wouldn't have hurt as it seemed like wax.
0,"There is nothing in the title or on the cover to indicate that this is a book whose sole intention is to convert you to Christianity.The first two pages are about anger, but by page three you are being told that Jesus loves you.Sad, that religious people feel the need to deceive others in order to get out their message."
1,"""Helter Skelter"" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."
0,The Rhomba is cheaply made. Mine stopped working completely after about two months. Piece of garbage.
1,"I had no idea we had this book, I found it in my basement :)Tomas is usually watched by his sister after school until is mother gets home, but one day his mother is late and late, so his sister leaves him alone so she can get to her job. He's a big boy, right?This book realistically covers the normal feelings of being scared on your first time alone in the house, and also Tomas' pride in his resourcefulness in having an impromptu party for his teacher when she shows up at his door (to invite his mother to a school meeting, apparently).A previous reviewer said the characters are African-American. This is possible, however, with the names Tomas and Ana I suspect they may be Hispanic instead. No matter, it's not a crucial plot point."
0,"Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want ""HOT STUFF""? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence. That's the ""A"" list of erotica. Warning don't view more than one of these at a time, they'll melt your VCR."

1,"This thing is freakin awesome! You can stand it up, lay it down, or rearrange to your liking. They are sturdy enough to hold several things: shoes, baby bags, blanky, and more! I use them as cubbies for my kids so they can stuff the things that we take with us everyday in there. I love it, and I am planning on getting more."
1,"I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house. I'm surprised that I get 75-80 percent signal strength from where I am, which was way less that my last one that had the small antenna attached directly to the pci card. All I can say is the price and the product are both awesome."
0,"I was a fan of Destiny's Child when the original girls were in the group. ""No, No, No"" was a hot song when it came. They were fresh young group with a different sound. ""Writings on the Wall"" made them a little more mainstream, but that was their best CD. Then the contraversy began, they were changing members like someone changing underwear. ""survivor"" was ok. This remix is one of the worst remix/greatest hits product on the market. Everyone has heard most of them on here. This is something that had to have been thrown together at the last minute. I'm not saying that they are talented. They can better than some vocalists out there, but Beyonce' overdoes it sometimes. We have been forced fed these ladies for the past year. Take some time off because you've ""worked"" so hard to get where you are. To add the DC3 drama, the latest rumor is Beyonce' and Kelly really are ""sisters"". It has been said that Matthew Knowles is Kelly's biological father."
1,"many people give 5 stars in a rather nonchalant manner completly nulling the value of the prestigious 5. This cd is the most essential black metal album I've ever come across. I do not sheepishly just ""give"" the five star rating, I stand by my rating proudly for all to see. THIS IS THE ONE! EPIC! also I do not listen to garbage black metal like most so you can trust my opinion. This album drives a sword through the pu@#y a!@ bellies of all other pu%$y a#@ bands. HAH HAH HAHp.s. kill nevermore"

1,"Dr. Barnard's ""Tackling Diabetes"" is only for those willing to listen carefully and summon up th discipline to follow his not-too-complicated Rx. It helps! I may later be able to say the type II I struggle with is gone. For the moment, I can say without hesitation, my blood sugar is considerably lower in the morning, which has been a constant problem for me. His clear, uncomplicated recommendations require commitment to a pattern of eating that can drastically reduce the presence of high glucose in one's blood, help reduce weight, and help bring about a certain amount of personal peace.My opinion is that all plans to 'self treat' diabetes should be shared with one's doctor."
1,"The devotion to detail, the honesty, the dignity, the humanity, the willingness to put a personal philosophy to the test-all these qualities come up roses in this book.On both levels, the level of person and the level of writer, the author seized the authentic moment of his reality and recognized the power that flows from his being able to totally accept and acknowledge himself, where he's at, and once able to do that with surprise, openness, a lack of bitterness, and an absorption in the moment, he's on your way."
0,E of Egypt is at one end and gypt at the other. Karachi is spelled Karacho. Portion of the Antartica is completely missing. Chittagong shows up in India instead of Bangladesh. Portions of Africa is missing.Buy a good globe even if it's for a small child who may not be ready for Geography lessons. It would be sad if the child turns out to be attentive and learns all the wrong lessons.
0,"Tom Brokaw knows better than his ""admiring"" comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his ""good old american image"", I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."
0,"See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it."
0,"well I have, and this book has got to be one of the stupidest things I have ever tried to write about. It is basically about nothing, and I had to write about that for a school paper! you would hate it too if you had to write about it for a flippin' school paper! Really, need I say more? I bet the people who loved it never had to write an essay about Amaranta's repeated refusal of love, and in about a week! Just ask everyone who's a junior at my school! It is a torture manual! Far too beastly a book to be dealt with, even for most english majors and teachers!I give it two stars because it has more substance than the stuff Allende and Amado put out."
1,"Philbrick writes a fascinating account of the struggles of the crew of the whaleship Essex after a disasterous encounter with a sperm whale. He manages to capture the essence of the mindset of the inhabitants of Nantucket, the whaling center of the U.S., which explains many of the actions of the crew. The fight for survival is portrayed with both clarity and emotionalism. Having no previous knowledge of this calamity, I was amazed that at the time it had a similar impact in the 1800's that the Titanic had in the 1900's. It was enlightening that this tragedy served as the inspiration for Melville's, Moby Dick, which I consider to be one of the masterpieces of American literature."
0,"This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment. The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here). Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself). If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!"
1,"After spending a lifetime on shakey unstable ladders, my first climb on the Little Giant made me wonder where it had been my whole life. While heavy, it offers stability unmatched and versatililty of application. It is worth every dollar."
0,"This series is a huge disappointment, in comparison with the fine nature programming I grew up with on public television. The scientific content here is low, and thus the educational value is poor. Instead, we are treated to disaster porn--stitched-together footage of calamaties and their aftermaths, plus alleged ""human interest"" stories as shameless as anything on the six o'clock news. Insultingly voyeuristic, if that's possible for Americans these days."
1,"A comment on the ""packaging"": Though the paper quality is nice, the book has rough cut edges, which for me makes the pages harder to turn. When flipping through, it's difficult to turn just one page at a time. Also, the print is a little hard to read; the font is Times style, and the thin parts of the font are much thinner than the thick parts, unusually so, making the letters harder to recognize."
1,"Completely captivating and amazing. When I saw the movie I knew nothing about it and I am glad otherwise the plot would have been ruined. So, I won't say anything about the plot.This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters. Everything in this film is amazing. It is one engaging film, from beginning to end.The DVD has very few Special Features. But, be sure to watch the deleted scenes. They are preceded by an interview with the director explaining why each of them was cut out of the film."
1,"""When You Believe"" is an awesome song. To me Mariah's songs hit me like nukes! The awesome duet performed with Whitney Houston I'll never get sick of. This song(to me) is combined with spiritual, and also relates to the racism. I personally recommend this song to both Kids and Adults!"
0,"I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
0,"We purchased the acclaimed, top end NS-ZCC-10 Neuro fuzzy rice cooker. We expected perfect rice because after all it incorporates the latest software and heating technology. We are very disappointed. Rice is overcooked and clumpy. We've tried to troubleshoot (more water, less water etc), but you know, the bottom line is that this cooker does not deliver excellent rice. We got better results with our no-tech, aluminum $50 plug in rice cooker.Very disappointed. I do not recommend you spend your money on this product."
0,"Bought this book along with Fodor's 05 New York City Guide and New York Eyewitness Travel Guide for our trip to New York in August. Overall this was the least informative book. The biggest problem is that the book mainly focuses on where to eat and where to stay, not what to see. If you want a book that details sights better, I would pick Fodor's 05 New York City Guide. I carried the book with me almost every day in New York, while the Frommer's guide was left in the hotel room to press flowers from the botanical garden."
1,"Besides the Introduction, I have only completely read the chapter on the Sand Creek Massacre so far, but it should be noted that the account is extraordinarily sympathetic to the acts of Chivington, his men, and the other officers, and offers a convincing rationale for the attack. It should be read by anyone familiar with the usual condemnations of the government's and individuals' actions for an eye-opening alternative point of view. It appears that the other nineteen chapters, each describing a different battle, are much more sympathetic to the Indians. All have the added fascination of being written by an author who lived at the time or within a generation of those events, and read like newspaper accounts and editorials. Recommended."
0,"If I hadn't promised to review this book for our school library, I would have stopped reading after the first chapter. This book is not well written, nor are the characters or subplots believable. I can't think of a single student I have ever had who I would recommend this book to. Very disappointing."

1,I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album.
0,"if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!"

1,"This is my favorite Batman movie. I'm a casual fan who doesn't know much about the details of the background from the comics, and I have not seen some of the older ones, so take that for what it's worth. But as a great story with great characters that looks great in blu-ray, it is hard to top Batman Begins. Most people I know preferred The Dark Knight when we saw it, but I stick by Begins as better of the two. With the new movie coming out, I encourage picking this up for your own collection or to show a friend who hasn't yet seen it."

1,"Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained."
1,"I wasn't expecting what I got with this book. Rather than an all out zombiefest, this turned out to be more of a character study. I was really drawn into the story by the end though. I have a feeling you'll either love this book or hate it though."
1,"This has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. J. B. Phillips is a Bible scholar who writes in a way a lay person can grasp his meaning. ""Your God Is Too Small"" has helped to mold my idea of a loving, inclusive God. I would say this book played a big part in making me a better Christian. I recommend it for Youth and up. Amust have in Christian publications."
1,"I have to say, I too am one of Clay's ""older"" fans. (Just under 38). He has been labeled as a broadway kind of singer, and the tunes he sang on American Idol were true Clay (belt-em-out) style. I don't hear this on this album. I do like the album, but it wasn't what I expected. I would love to see him do another album, maybe of some show tunes or the like. Don't get me wrong, I could listen to him sing everyday, all day. It just doesn't get any better than that voice... Would love to see Solitaire on the next one. Also got to say I'm loving the articles. Way to go for standing up for yourself and who you are, even though I loved the belly shot on Rolling Stone. I do give you some serious credit. Fighting the big boys can't be easy. Keep the albums coming."

0,"This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."

1,"My Trans-metropolitan counterpart beneath me definitely describes this cd well. I love the reference to Wallpaper, perhaps the greatest magazines ever (with Surface, Homme, and maybe Metropolitan Home) not far behind.But I digress... This cd, as with all of the releases in this series is excellent. Tosca's contribution is, of course, amazing. However, the entire width and breadth of this release is one that permanenty stays in the player.However, I would strongly urge you to seek out ""Volume Five"" of this series. It offers your senses two cd's of the finest Compost has to offer. I found it a local vendor, new, for an amazing price (under $15).A very, very worthwhile release...will not disappoint you."

0,"Let's call a cat a cat. It is a weak Michener. If it is the first you read, it will probably your last. Michener, in the afterword, tells us that The Journey was originally in his book Alaska but was cut by the editor. He then took that section and made a book.The premises are good. A party of adventurers, including a snob British Lord, a poet, a retired Colonel and a cunning Irishman go on a journey to the Yukon River during the gold rush. This is too little to make a book.There is some good characters interraction, some good moments but they are drowned in the long repetitive parts of the journey, to the point where you keep thinking something will happen and...If you want a good Michener, look at my review of the Covenant or Poland, forget The Journey"
1,"For most people Polish history between the wars is probably a mystery. This book fills that gap admirably. It reveals how Jozef Pilsudski was truly the founding father of a reborn nation. This is his story just as much as Poland's, but then the two are so closely tied together that their's is one story. A fascinating and easy read. Thoroughly recommended to those who have an interest in this area."

1,"I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off!

0,"This is a marketing gimmick to get the hard earned dollars out of a music lovers pocket. None of the remixes made the song any better, in my opinion. And the glaring horrible ""Dot"" with its caustic tone and scathing chorus that informs people who don't like Beyonce to ""Shut Up!"" In addition, the verse contains the self-pitying line ""Just blame it on B-E-Y-O-N-C-E."" Making it difficult for the listener to empathise with her at all.The tender ""Emotions"" suffered most of all from Beyonce's over the top singing and the funkifying it went through to be called a remix. What was wrong with the original? That is an Excellent song!In closing, pass this one over! You're not missing anything!"
0,Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.

1,"Having never heard of this band before, I picked up this album from a Border's Bookshop store where I could sample the tunes first. Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing. I cannot recomment this album more highly!"
0,"Unfortunately, this book just made me more angry.This book might be okay for a person who subscribes to the religious views of the authors, but since I do not, I was annoyed at having been duped into buying a religious book under the guise of a psychology book, not to mention the bad advice inside it. I tried to get through it anyway, but after two valiant attempts (if I do say so myself) I decided I couldn't do it. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I wrote it in (as the book instructs) before I saw the religious stuff. Also, nowhere on the front does it say anything about religion, and only in tiny, tiny text above the barcode does it say it should be categorized as ""religious"" and the category ""psychology"" is absent."

0,"When I turned 12, 5 years ago, I received the iZ on Christmas from my aunt and at first I thought this would be really cool. Oh how wrong I was. First and foremost it does not turn off, even at the age of 17 I still cannot figure out how to turn this contraption off. It basically plays the same looped annoying beat for hours on end while adding even more mind-numbing effects into the mix. This leads me into my next point: the sound effects and ""voice"" of this demonic figure can induce many nightmares. Honestly, this ""voice"" is so soul crushing I would rather be deaf then have to listen to this toy speak and/or make noise. This toy has fallen from my shelf several times over the years and it literally takes me hours to turn off. This toy should be avoided at all cost because it is a perpetual, annoying toy that only plays infuriating effects over a terrible looped beat."
1,"It's a fun movie that involves SpongeBob...kids LOVE. It's 87 mins, and gives you plenty of time to get the cleaning and/or cooking done. Shipping and product was great."
0,"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
0,"Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."
0,"I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead."
0,This is a delightful set of four short stories about the magic of Christmas.Each short is animated in either vivid color or black and white. 30 min. total playing time. Each has its own personality and charm. The stories can be used for discussion about Christmas between parents or teachers and young children. There is freshness in each. Few opportunities exist to share a Christmas story classic that is very short and talk about it with young folks. Makes them excitingly aware of the famed comic figure Howdy Doody and animation in fun terms.I watched it from the viewpoint of both a young child and parent. Four **** for delight and colorful fun that often brings out the smiles in young silent children otherwise prone to remain quiet. At a low price too. Not worth the new VHS price.Four Stars.
1,Hands down pampers are the best diapers. Never had a problem with leaking or skin breakdown on my baby.
0,"When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting a good deal because of the cheaper price. However, once I received it, I knew I had made a mistake. I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
1,A Must for any Wireless Network User. Hook up is very simple and takes less than 5 min. per Tivo in your home.
0,"I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan."
0,this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!
1,"I read ""Trouble on Titan"" around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy ""Trouble on Titan."""
0,"The pro-Richard effluvium is getting rather overwhelming here, so for all of you who think this is actually a history book, I'll recommend another book by a real scholar: The Princes in the Tower, by Alison Weir."
0,The box looked used and it is obviously not new. I have tried to contact them by email and no response. Don't buy from them!
1,This account of an epic adventure suffered from what I'd call `reportage'. As I read this exciting book I found myself longing for the enthralling descriptive power of Patrick O'Brian marvelous prose. So imagine my joy in discovering -The Unknown Shore- by O'Brian! The final part of that book is strikingly similar to - In the Heart of the Sea-. O'Brian's masterful capacity to evoke the verisimilitude of his sailor's plight wonderfully enhanced my memory the Essex book. I was so pleased!
0,"Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage."
1,"This disc captures the first 1950s recordings of wild blues harmonica man Kid Thomas. These Chicago recordings predate the timing of his most well-known song ""Rockin' This Joint Tonight"" (if you can call it that, because I acknowledge Thomas is pretty obscure to begin with), but are great nonetheless, due to Kid's intense approach to 1950s-era Chicago electric blues. The overall feel is rough and tumble, and if you have any appreciation for Chess Records, this probably takes it a step further, as far as rocking goes.Be forewarned though - There are different takes of the same song, and several false starts on others, but the disc was such a rush upon first listen for me because of Kid's approach to the blues that I immediately played it again - it's been a while since a blues cd has done that to me."
1,"The sound quality of this rivals the Bose tabletop; certainly its a better value for the price. Its not as attractive and a little larger, but the features are well placed and the remote is very useful.Mine got damaged by a bad surge, so if you get one, use a surge protector with it to preserve it."
0,"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"

L'estimation pour la rparation et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgr son excellente sonorit, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile  comprendre, parfois il gle...  viter!"
0,"I bought this book for my son as he wanted to study for ASVAB test and when I was helping him study by reading him the test there were many many answers incorrect in the back of the book. When checking to see if an answer was incorrect or correct there were lots of mistakes. I was aware of some of the answers and knew they were wrong, but if a person was in the dark about what the answer would be they would go on the incorrect answer. So, this is not a book I would recommend for studying."
0,"I've just received it as a persent for my birthday amongst another 8 or 10 CDs. At first it caught my eye better than any of the rest, but I feel very dissapointed because of the (almost all) live recordings, which I don't expect in a collection named ""Greatest Hits"". The saddest part is that it sinks all my interest in Pete Seeger for quite a while.Those who know the artist well, what would recommend me to re-start?"
0,"This movie, despite having a truly excellent sound design, is just another hokey Hollywood special effects show. Shirley Jackson's novel, quite possibly the finest haunted house story ever written, is tossed aside in favor of easy to communicate cliches and stock shocks (I guessed the BIG SURPRISE TWIST ENDING about three minutes into it and was waiting for all the other stupid characters to catch on). The worst movie of 1999 belongs in the same company as Golden Turkey winners Orca, the Killer Whale, The Swarm, and Exorcist 2: The Heretic."
1,I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font. Publishers-- someone work with the author to get a shiny new updated version please!
1,It was a very good book. It explains in full detail the history of Goju-ryu karate. It also has step by step instructions for katas with black and white pictures. Almost every page has a picture. This book also has a glossary with the Japanese terms translated from Japanese to English and English to Japanese with the phoenetic pronunciation. Motoo Yamakura is a very good martial arts writer.
0,"I gave this book this raiting because it was hard to understand. The words were very hard and I didn't know any of them. The book did have a good plot but they made it to hard to know what it meant. This book did teach us about sea life, which was the ONLY thing in my opinion. I would only reccomend this book for highschoolers."
0,"I'm sorry to every Claymate out there but Clay Aiken isn't really my type. He's annoying, whiny, and not meaningful. It seems like hes marketing to 5th graders and his mom. Invisible is NOT a meaningful love song, its just pure pop. If you want to listen to meaningful male vocals, I would suggest Coldplay, Keane, or Alexi Murdoch.I do think that Clay Aiken has a good voice for Broadway or theater, but when he produces an over the top pop album such as this, he's wasting his talent."
0,"One of my 4 Neoprene seat covers got ripped by a vacuum cleaner after just 1 year, something that should not happen to begin with. But Coverking customer service is not helping and would not sell just the replacement seat cover, has to sell 2 at a time, at full retail. Beware of their durability and quality control, and definitely beware of the customer service, or lack thereof."
0,"Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic. One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun. Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama. I perfer the first two"
