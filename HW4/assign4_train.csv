1,"This is a little longer and more detailed than the first two books in the series. However, I have enjoyed each new aspect of the exciting fantasy universe."
0,Only Michelle Branch save this album!!!!All guys play along with unenthusiastic beat!!! even Karl
1,"A surprisingly good book, given its inherently problematic nature: a group of white people pretend to be Hindu gods on another planet. Yet Zelazny appears to have done his research, creating a rich world and using the character of Siddhartha to skillfully question the ways of the ""gods"". The world rang true, to my admittedly limited experience of Asia, but that's more than some books about Asia manage. Lord of Light is a book that wears its problematic nature on its sleeve, and opens itself for the attendant discussion. Also, it tells a good story."
1,"This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out."
0,"The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. The product description is vague if not poor.The lights received are much smaller than in the photo (an inch in diameter). They are useless as illumination. I live in a high-sun area and have placed the charger in a position where it gets sun from dawn to dusk. The cord from the charger and the lights is long, which allows you to place the charger on the roof. In the end they are not worth the price."
0,"I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."
1,"I'm not much of a ""hard rock"" fan. I enjoy it from time to time, but I mainly listen to Radiohead, older hip-hop, etc. But this album got me hooked.One day, many years after the release of Toxicity, I decided to check it out. Right after the first track, ""Prison Song"", I knew this was going to be a great album. The great riffs and political lyrics basically told me I was in for a treat. And I sure as hell was. Serj Tankian's interesting [but awesome] vocals and catchy guitars and drum beats make for an awesome listen. Check it out.-Jeff"
0,This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it.
1,"Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
0,"I think that Mr. Marquez is a far superior story teller than he is a writer. It is too bad you can't sit around a fire listening to his stories instead. This book basically has no overall plot, but many smaller plots for each little story within it. I thought the sheer number of characters who names were similar (if not the same) was very annoying. I had a hard time connecting with any of the characters due to the weaving in and out of other characters. I know that there was a family tree in the beginning, but I just got tired of flipping back to the point that I just did not care.To the average reader, without a discussion group or a literary expert, many of the ""hidden gems"" will be missed if there are any. On the whole, I just couldn't shake the vibe that I was reading an extended version of the Old Man and the Sea.It was interesting from the point of reading a Mexican writer."
0,"With the exception of Chop Suey and Forest, this album is nothing but screaming over intense power chords....and to me that is not music. How can everyone say that this is such a masterpiece? You want a masterpiece that rocks? Check out Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"" or ""Black Album"" or Cigar's ""Speed is Relative"" or any of the earlier stuff by Led Zeppelin. This album has a few nice moments, but those moments are more than offset by moments of crap. Yes, sometimes Serj Tankian hits a pretty note or sometimes they play a cool guitar riff or drum fill, but there is too much incoherent screaming and angry, cliched death metal nonsense. Too many bands think that in order to rock they have to scream and play their guitars as loudly as possible. Jimmy Page didnt play super loud and intense power chords, and he was one of the best guitarists of all time! You dont have to be loud simply for the sake of being loud to rock, and these guys do not rock."
1,"""Of Mice and Men"" is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."
1,"Clay Aiken's voice shines on this CD!!!! I bought this and well, I have bought one for my mom for her birthday. She has not been able to put it down!! She has listened to it over and over. Thank you Clay for a wonderful album and I can't wait till the next one!"
1,This wonderful book has a great Southwest twist and the illustrations are incredible!
1,"This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way"" also loved ""Touch"" (sounds like Marc Antony),and ""Perfect Day"" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked ""When You say You Loved Me"", very catchy."
1,"This book is a great introduction to a fantastic author that is often overlooked by American readers. ""Zorba"" is fascinating, deep, and hilarious, all at once, and it's short and playful enough such that it won't turn off more casual readers. I recommend this title as a starting point for people who want to read Nikos Kazantzakis for his philosophical insights or for his moving stories."
0,"A truly lousy record. ""wiretap scars"" were in many ways briliant but something went wrong with ""porcelain"". The album give no memorable riffs or chorus what so ever. Each song sound alike and after a while you are really bored. A truly lousy record"
0,This is a complete waste of money for any real Stooges fan. You do get three DVDs. One is cartoon stooges. One is Laurel and Hardy. Only one is 3 Stooges -1 Curly episode and 2 Shemp episodes. My husband is a huge Stooges fan and couldn't watch anything except the Curly episode. I don't feel it was properly advertised on the box.
1,"Equip yourself with this handbook of New Age facts, doctrines, comparisons, and rebuttals. This manual will help you educate the precious souls that are being blinded by the dangerous New Age movement. Learn the difference between the Jesus they preach, and the Jesus we know."
1,"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."
0,"Being a fan of Isabelle Huppert's work, I expected something more from this film. The only good thing about this film, as a matter of fact, was Huppert's performance of a woman coming undone. She lives her relatively closed (and closely monitored by her live-in mother) life as a piano teacher, and everything seems stern, put together (except for this bizarre relationship with her mother, who controls everything). And then Huppert's much-younger student begins to pursue her. By the time Huppert succumbs, she is unraveling. At the same time, the movie unravels with her."
0,"Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums. But haven't you all noticed you can play Wonderwall and Live Forever directly over all of these tracks? I give'em 2 for being consistent."
1,"This book is a great resource for planning an Alaskan adventure. Area by area recommendations and descriptions are given to help the reader determine how best to meet his/her vacation goals.Especially helpful are the web addresses for individual services and locations, as well as the recommendations for the slightly-lesser known and (in the author's opinion) less crowded activities and the corresponding suggestions for how to beat crowds and how to plan ahead to have the experience you want.The general over-view information of each area also helps give the reader a good impression of the area and what the overall experience of the area would be like.A very thorough book."
0,"I purchased the 350 wireless adapter as a second adaptor for a second laptop on my wireless LAN. My first laptop has a Compaq WL110 PCMCIA adaptor which out performs the Cisco hands down on range and connectivity. The Cisco comes with some fancy disgnostic tools which states signal to noise ratios with no loss whereas a simple ping test clearly displays packet loss. I am disappointed as a IT proffessional and someone who thought that a cisco card would be the best. Not the case, buy Compaq or 3com."
1,Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size.
0,The quality of rice is inadequate to satisfy anyone who likes sushi. I am really surprised that Sanyo makes such bad quality product. I returned the product.
0,"I had to add my two cents because reading the good reviews about this movie blew my mind. They had to have all been written by 13 year old teeny boppers. I only sat through this movie because the people I went to the theater with needed a ride home. I was really looking forward to this movie too. The commercials made it look like it was going to be hot chicks doing wild and crazy stuff at the bar through the whole thing but I'd have to say that only about 15 minutes of this movie took place at the bar. Piper Perabo annoyed the crap out of me. She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, ""Look how cute and adorable I am."" The story was trite and cliche'... I actually felt insulted that the director thought I might be stupid enough to buy into this ridiculous crap. If you aren't a 13 year old girl don't go see this."
1,"I have three children in diapers. My oldest is 4 years old and is autistic. We have not been able to potty train him yet.We tried several brands only to find out that Pampers Baby Dry was always the one we went back to. No question! No leaks! But the cost of our diapers just adds up. Amazon has the absolute cheapest price I have found - in stores or on-line. And free shipping, and I got (...) off with a promotion for baby items over (...) prurchased. I made out! And never had to leave my door! Thanks Amazon! Really!"
1,"Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique."
0,"I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it."
1,"It works like a charm. Well, it won't work over the more secure WPA encryption, but it works great with standard encryption.My complaint: It's clunky. On a computer desktop, it's alright to have something that needs to sit on the desk and connect to the PC with a USB cord. My TiVo, however sits stacked between my DVD player and my XBox. The USB WiFi adapter is forced to perch precariously on the back of the shelf. It'd be better if it was designed to just fit right into the USB port, like the one I bought for my girlfriend's computer (which cost $10 less).The TiVo is supposed to work with other brands of wireless network adapters, but I figured the safe choice was to buy the TiVo brand. Overall, I'm not disappointed."
0,Looks great. Fits our space. Holds right number of bottles for us. But temperature either 40 or 60 degrees. Neither good for storing wine. Cannot get the temperature we want. Would send it back. But major undertaking for me--too heavy and bulky. Keeping as extra frig.
1,"I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better."
0,"We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
1,"How refreshing it is to hear someone sing BIG again! While there are some uncomfortable moments on the album, Clay has definitely shown us what he has to offer the music world. One can't help but feel the urge to grab up some Steve Perry/Journey albums after listening to this. We haven't heard a male voice this soulful since Captain Big Voice (Perry) left the scene. Hopefully this is just the tip of the iceberg."
0,"This is the worst diaper we ever tried. After my 20 months old daughter go to bad (changing diaper at 9pm) we have to change it at around 4am, otherwise she (her outfit, bad and comforter) will be totally wet by the morning. We had no other diaper with such an experience. During daytime it is even worse, sometimes it start letting thru everything after few hours. We use 5-7 diapers a day whereas we needed only 3-4 from cruisers. This simply have not enough absorbent to stay dry for 12 hours (as advertised)"
0,"Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
1,"An aging German pope sends our hero, Michener, on a mission to find the true hidden secrets of the message given by the Virgin to the children of Fatima in 1917. Meanwhile the Pope's Secretary, a scoundrel of the highest order, has his sights set on his life long ambitions of becoming the next pope. In a breathless search through medieval papal archives and to Bosnia, the site of the latest Mary apparition, we are led to a nifty grand finale, as all the pieces fit together to a final ""Proof"" of the Virgin's Mary's Reality, and God's existence as well. This is a lively ride thru Church/ Papal history with interesting characters and settings to match, and I admit I breezed right thru!"
0,"Candide is my favorite book, and I've read it multiple times in boh french and english. This is by far the worst english translation I've come across. It makes absolutely no attempt to preserve the grammatical structure of Voltaire's original, and consequently much of the irony and wit is lost. Read Candide, but not this copy.The Signet edition is not bad."
1,This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.
1,It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.
0,"Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
1,"Great product and even better price. If you compare to Costco, Target, etc. you will not find a deal better than this."
0,"Somethings Just aren't Worth reviewing ...This is one of Them !Run from this feature ! I couldn't even finish watching it and I love Demon movies ! If U thought ""Lost Souls"" was bad it is a revalation compared to this !"
1,My wife purchased a pair of rubber soled walking shoes. Would you believe the sole on both shoes opened an the center and needed to be reglued. took them to a local shoemaker and he wanted $22.00 plus tax to repair... No I said...I went to Amazon and purchased Shoe Goo for much less and reglued the soles my self. It worked well. Others suggested that I have plenty of rubber bands availabe and I did and used them to hold the soles in place during the bonding process. I give the product 5 stars.
1,"My daughter has a lot of shoes. She used to just either leave them on the floor or would toss them in a empty laundry basket.The rack was easy to put together and so far have had no problems. It holds all of her shoes and takes up little space.The only drawback I saw was that you see the bottoms of the shoes and you wouldn't want to put heavier shoes all on one side.We are very pleased and if the needs again arises, I will buy another one. I am glad I bought it."
0,"When I ordered the book it was listed as ( like new ) Hog Wash ! the inside of the book was high lighted with yellow lighter and ink pen from beginning to end , there is hardly one page that is not completely marked up. What the heck ? I bought the book for a gift ( one the best book on the planet by the way ) the book is an heirloom, I was very disappointed , the delivery time was good, but the condition of the book is just crap. For me there is no way to correct this at this point, I needed it by this coming Friday... absolute disappointment !Dan Hall"
1,"DEEP...MOODY...AND SPIRITUAL. WHEN THEY BURY ME, I WANT PSALM TO BE PLAYING AND IF THE GOOD LORD IS WILLING, I HOPE THERE IS AN ACCOMPANING THUNDERSTORM. AFTERWARDS, THEY CAN ALL GO THROW ONE BACK IN MY HONOR AND TELL LIES ABOUT ME. THIS CD IS A CLASSIC."
0,Did a ton of research before purchasing a Danby wine cooler...it stopped working after owning it 15 months...just stopped for no reason at all. You are throwing your money away if you purchase this item.
1,"Personally I think this is the best Batman movie ever made. Yeah the car isn't what we all know it to be, but the action and the storyline is quite good. The antagonist is kind of unlike any other movie which is bizarre but at the same time interesting. This is because you actually see Batman with unpredictable struggles rather than not being able to kill his enemy the first time they fight."
1,I purchased 2 pair of Converse Chuck Taylor tennis shoes for my granddaughter's Christmas gift. They were delivered before the projected date and were exactly what the girls wanted. I will not hesitate to order from them again.
0,"This geek reminds me of a watered down Elton John except that one thing, real talent. She he can sing but at leased Elton John wrote his own songs. Clay's voice sounds a lot like Elton's but too bad his 15 minutes of fame are up. He will always have the words ""American Idol"" written beneath him which is why he will not go far. He is an Elton John-wannabe like Kelly Clarkson is a Mariah Carey-wannabe."
0,"This book isn`t worth the paper it is written on!!It contained nothing of substance.Where did this couple live?What were their last names?What was a day like at home for the mother(Hyacynth)?What were her children like?What was important to her?These are just a few of the subjects not even touched upon by the author.I couldn`t get past the first 100 pages.I hav not read any of this authors other books since Evergreen,which I loved.This book was a waste of my time and money.I will not ever waste anymore money on this authors books."
1,I've had this case for a few months now and still love it. I used the bottom DVD slot for my DVD burner and used the top slot to wrap all the excess cables from the power supply. Keeps the inside of the case clean and simple with good air flow. I purchased a multi card reader with a USB 3.0 port to fit in the floppy slot. Added some ram with led's which lights up the case perfectly. Overall great case. No complaints.
0,"Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again."
1,"Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD."
1,"The new CD by Celine Dion is really good. The French lyrics add a sweet touch to the ear, and each song is exquisite and unique. Tout l'or des hommes is unique in its hard rock theme. Apprends-moi seems a bit too pop ballady. My favorite on the album, Le vol d'un ange, is a emotionally touching and a beautiful-tuned song. Je lui dirai is very funky, and Ne bouge pas is hilarious. Get the CD!"
1,"I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
0,Simply unreadable. A nonsense book and a ridiculous plot. Sincerely one of the worst books I've ever read.
0,I didn't look carefully and didn't realize this was only the single...a good live track of Hey Man Nice Shot but I had intended to get the whole album
0,"Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
1,"I agree with everything said by everyone else, but the piece that really really grabs me is ""Jessica's Lullaby"". It's a masterpiece composition and performance, absolutely beautiful!!! I've worn my CD out and I just ordered a replacement."
0,"I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day."
0,The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with.
0,"A book from the author of Struts, can you possibly go wrong? This book shows you can. The book does not have a flow to it, to me it seems just scattered topics piled on eachother. And then, the grand finale, where all you have ""learned"" is applied in a real world type of thing... By the time it got there, I got so annoyed I did not care anymore. The examples rely on so much non-standard struts stuff, I have trouble with the title even."
0,"i think the love brids are hyping this movie up, this is a review from someone that doesnt by into the love movie Douche thing: Not adams best, very repeatative movie. I dont think he will ever make another Happy gilmore, or Billy madison movie."
0,"What I go was the same old boy band sound at its worst. I really feel sorry for the group because only ONE song should have been released and that was ""Faded"". It is the lone entertaining track on the CD. There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it. It will turn them off of Boybands for the rest of their lives. It only asks one interesting question: did they honestly think that they had a good, artistic album there before they released this?"
0,"My son loves the appearance of the shoe, but the item description is very misleading.Product Features Listed in Description:-leather-Soft, calfskin leather upper-A youth shoe that employs powerpulse technology for optimal kicking power-Eva insole for comfort-Split outsole for optimal weight and flexibilityThe tag on the shoe actually lists a synthetic upper. I would not recommend this seller based on the deceptive advertising."
1,"Great book read it when i was a teen, along with all his other books.Bought it as a gift for an aspireing writer"
1,"Look at Charles Sharp's review I totally agree with him. Got this book today, nice book but not for the beginner."
1,this album is so old school in its heavy hitting beats. I'm addicted. There is nothing sad on this album (except for the very serious song babymother {about becoming an unexpectant father}). It's a feel good CD. Even the leaveamessage track is fun.
0,"The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
1,"This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me."
0,"As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story"
0,"Bought this for the Christmas lights 1 for outside and one for the tree,works great EVEN WITH EVERY OTHER REMOTE YOU HAVE WILL TURN IT ON OR OFF,AND DRIVE YOU CRAZY!!!!THE CAR REMOTE/ GARAGE/ HANDY SWITCHES ALL TURNED THE LIGHTS ON"
1,"I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended."
1,"This is the best C.D. on earth!! I listen to it all the time. I like this one better than their self titled because it's got more techno in it, so you can really dance to it. Also, it's a little more upbeat than their last one. There's more of a variety in the music. It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9). Every track is a good one, and there's some meaningfull lyrics as well. Do yourself a tremendous favor and BUY THIS C.D.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Pardon me, Mr. Owen, but weren't you a character in ""High Fidelity""?""Dry the Rain"" is as representative of the band as any other song, and I often bob my head while listening to it.That notwithstanding, this is an excellent, quirky cd. Some songs are more straightforward, others are weird instrumental fun. Kind of like Cornershop without the South Asian influence."
1,"This is the easiest Thomas Hardy novel, but one of the most complex in terms of emotions. Being an English literature fan, I have to say that the story that goes on in this book is one of the most original and refreshing. If you found Tess of the DUrbervilles (another Hardy book) too difficult but loved the general storyline, read this, it's simpler for the simple minds out there."
1,"When Katherine Tyler, Kit, comes to stay with her Aunt Rachel's family in the Connecticut, she knows her new home will never be the same as her old home, Barbados. Kit doesn't seem to fit in in this strict Puritan colony. When her young sailor friend, Nat, is around, he's always teasing and that doesn't really help, either.Then Kit befriends Widow Hannah Tupper, a.k.a. (also known as), the Witch of Blackbird Pond. With Hannah Tupper, Kit can let go and speak her real feelings. She feels almost as happy as she did back in Barbados. And she cannot understand why everyone is so misunderstanding towards Hannah Tupper.So when Kit's new family warns her to stay away from Hannah Tupper, to avoid trouble from the rest of the town, Kit ignores them. Unfortunately, her friendship with the so-called witch is discovered. And Kit is also accused of witchcraft!"

It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
1,Is one the great anime that will bring tear in your eye. Is very catching and heart breaking same time.
1,Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.
1,"This book features one of the first Troll-Dwarf Friendships ever to hit the stands. Cuddy the dwarf does a great job of killing the practice dummy explaning that the fugative does not have to be able to answer questions. As well as the return of the 6 foot(adopted) dwarf, Carrot, the librairan, who is a very funny ape(don't call him a monkey), and Gaspode the wonder dog. He is very good at persuasion."
0,"Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ."
0,"I purchased this product expecting to save some of the shoes with soles that have dry rotted here in the Caribbean and the Shoe Goo wouldn't stay. I tried with several pairs of shoes, from tennis shoes to sandals and the results were poor in all the cases."
0,"Let me just start by saying that I am formally educated in music. Unfortunately, I have the exact same criticism about Clay that many (including Simon) have. He's got a huge voice, but he lacks emotion. He can hit high notes, his voice has a richness, but obvious Clay knows nothing of what he sings about. Song stylists are able to show off their voices and make the audience feel it at the same time. That's the sort of thing that separates the Wayne Newton's from the Bruce Springsteen's....or the Kelly Clarkson's from the Sheryl Crowe's. Mr. Aiken just doesn't have that. Screaming out some notes is not singing, it's just plain screaming. And that's the reason he was voted number two and not number one on American Idol. It's not enough to hit notes, make me feel it...I want to feel what the song is saying. Otherwise, seeing or hearing you perform is not worth the price charged."
1,"This is a fantastic diaper. It can do what it says-- stand up to a 12 hours of peeing overnight. It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box."
1,My 8 year old boy just loves his sword ( the black color and the design). The toy is plastic and very light and SAFE. My son has it for 3 weeks and it's still in good condition so far. Very pleased about the purchase.
1,"Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement."
0,"These guys are in the same category as RPWL. Their music is decent, enteretaining - basically some good tunes. But some of the songs that are longer get boring because there is no new music introduced - they just keep repeating the basic tune. These guys certainly don't come close to the masters of prog like Genesis, Marillion, Flower Kings, IQ, etc. I wouldn't buy any more of their CD's based on this one."
1,Some of there best work. One of the most original bands out. this album was ahead of its time. Awesome!
1,"My husband and I drink instant coffee every morning before going to the office. For a long time I've been seeking the perfect coffee maker to elevate our coffee drinking pleasure, but for many reasons it's just simpler, quicker and hotter to drink instant coffee. So, you might call me an instant coffee connoisseur, because I've tried nearly all the instant varieties available at our local market. I can't say I adore any of them, but Nescafe rises to the top of the list when I rank them by taste, aroma and creme."
0,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you....Jack Wagner reincarnated. Or is it Michael Bolton? Either way, this sound should have died with the 80's. For those who claim Clay is a boy band extension, may I respectfully say: PUH-LEEZE! The kid has a nice voice, but this is not pop music. This is your mom's Kenny G with vocals."
0,"This book poses somewhat of a conundrum. Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise? The answer: it is both! It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa. Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep. If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book. If not, don't bother."
1,"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
1,"When you finish reading 1984, you don't know what to do with yourself for the next couple of hours. The themes of the novel are so thought provoking and powerful that it leaves you stupefied. However, the book is more than just a philosophical message. One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!"
1,"I bought these diapers because of the incredible deal with the Subscribe and Save/Amazon Mom discount combo (note: the price has now increased from when I ordered in June). The diapers are ""good"" in that they haven't leaked. They do not get 5 stars for the following reason: They are a little ""flimsy"". So, even if my daughter doesn't need a diaper change due to contents, she needs a diaper change more often because they lose their shape around her and don't cover her well. I did not have this problem with the Sam's Club brand diapers. So, although they were slightly less expensive per diaper, I have ended up using MORE diapers because I have to change my daughter more often. Other than the ""flimsiness"", I like the diapers."
0,With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this.
0,"I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."
1,"We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand."
1,"This was a great movie.It was beutifly made. It will scare you bad. Its cast fits the parts like pieces to a puzzle. Catherine Zeta Jones,Liam nesson,Liv Taylor,and Owen Wilson are great. Four people go to a haunted house not knowing it was haunted.Boy,are they in for a scare."
1,"Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger."
0,"I don't get it. I love this band and have turned numerous friends on to them. All have been impressed, but their DVDs blow! Almost unwatchable due to there is seldom more than 3 seconds and typically 1 to 1 1/2 seconds of viewing without a camera angle change or change to somewhere else on stage. No continuity whatsoever! Dizzying and not in a good way. I was so excited to watch this. Bought both of the DVDs and watched each to about the 5th song before stopping in complete dissappointment. Watch and judge for yourself, but I became quite sour on these guys due to this, though I love their music and I'm sure this feeling will subside, but the DVDs are in the trash. There is ZERO opportunity to ""get in to the song"" with all of the viewing changes. There are so many awesome live concert videos available from numerous bands, but PT DVDs are NOT them! Sorry PT fans, but you must have received different DVDs than I. But do go and buy ALL of their CDs. Great Band!"
0,"Well, i bought this monitor about 2 months ago.. at the time i also needed a tv..so i thought this was a great buy..took it home set it up and boy it was awesome...the picture was great..(internet)....evrything was fine until about a month after i noticed that it would just shut down..then i would try to turn it back on and it wouldnt..so it takes for me to unplug for a few min then restart..since then it still shuts down..or freezez...i think that this item in general is defective..i noticed other people had the same problem..as of right now im waiting for my replacement..."
1,"Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."
1,"I subscribed this item at Amazon once two months, Great service! I usually got it the day after the subscribed date. Amazingly fast!"
0,See this move for Matt Schue. I think that is his name. If it is the long haired blonde dude. He is so hot.
0,"All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
1,"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"
0,"Wow. This was bad. The only redeeming quality was the babes in the tight leather pants. Take those scenes and those girls out of this clunker and you quite possibly have the worst movie ever made. But Tyra did look good.....Would I recommend it? - sure, if nothing else for the visuals, which is really the only reason this film was made. It's sort of like Maxim magazine on film. Just watch it with the sound off, maybe while listening to a good CD. Believe me, you won't miss anything."
1,"This is an amazing Catholic movie which portrays the entire life of the great Saint Padre Pio. It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways. This movie has an amazing ending so it is worth watching until the end."
1,"If you want the best Oasis for the Oasis sound, purchase ""Definately Maybe"" or ""The Masterplan."" If you want a great album of a different sound, buy ""Be Here Now."" The band was on its best behavior and performance, taking the time to make 12 quality tracks.Some of the top tracks, ""D'You Know What I Mean,"" ""Fade In/Out"" ""Magic Pie"" and ""All Around the World."" I hope that on their next album, Noel takes the time to sing lead on a few more songs. I have yet to hear a bad Oasis song with him singing lead."
0,"The movie infatuated sub-literate ""reviews"" of this adaptation immediately turned me off, they can probably only ingest it in audio format. The Amazon no-name who misspelled HARLAN ELLISON's name didnt help, he's a vastly better writer than roth, and the only reason I was going to buy these tapes, guess not."
0,"The book is full of religious references, and not especially helpful overall. I would not recommend this book for anyone dealing with angry people or angry themselves."
1,I did't buy this card for gaming purposes but to watch movies that I had on my computer. The quality was not that bad and setup was fairly easy. Just follow the directions and your set. This card comes with an s-video output so it doesnt look that bad when it goes on tv. The price is pretty good and it does its job. The only expensive thing was when i had to get long audio and s-video cables.
1,"This is the best tragedy ever written. I wish this had professional audio! I recommend this book to any, and everyone."
0,"I ordered the Dashmat under the premise that it was an easy install, being mechanically retarded this appealed to me....lol...I'm sure it would have been easier had the velcro that came with it actually stuck to the dash. I did what the instructions said, clean the dash thoroughly with a mild solution, NO Armoral, my dash hadn't seen Armoral in 10 years in fact. So after fighting, sweating, and swearing over the non-sticky velcro I found myself at the auto store looking for industrial strength velcro. After about 2 hours I had it installed."
0,This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author.
1,Very good product. Just a advertised. Was worth every little penny I spent! Very happy with this purchase! Awesome! Pleased!
0,"I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."
1,"After my son broke the mirror on our sporttrac by clipping another mirror on a narrow street, I ordered this replacement part for a fraction of what the dealer quoted me for fixing the mirror. Found a video on youtube on how to remove the door panel and within about 10-15 minutes I had the new mirror installed and working perfectly."
1,"This is a great cd if you loved the music in the game. It seems to cover songs from the begining of the game to the very end. It has ocarina songs, main themes, store songs and more. I've had the cd a week and I love it. Overall this is a great cd and I recomend this if you love the music in the game."
0,"This game could have been a nice RPG game.However, the large number of bugs makes the game unbearable.I've seen many computer games, and this takes the cakefor the number of errors, glitches, freezes, bugs...Save your money."
0,"I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."
0,I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart.
0,Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
1,"I bought 2 of these for both my husband and me. The review that said it was a little too small for men's shoes doesn't apply to us. My husband wears an average size 10 shoe and has no problem fitting several pairs of shoes on this rack. Assembly is very easy and once assembled, the shelves swivel so you can easily get to any shoe. It's also very sturdy and quite large. If I have to say anything negative at all, it would be that it's almost too big to put two of them in one 6 x 10 walk-in closet. Other than that, it is a perfect alternative to leaving shoes on the floor. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,Simple if you ride Dressage or know some one who does they should get this magazine.It keeps you up to date with what's going on I'n the sport and has great articles from different experts every month.Great Gift
1,"Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem)."
0,"The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more ""transfers"" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma ""studios"" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie? Who knows...you can barely see it. If Troma gets its hands on the great ""Suspiria"" there is no God."
0,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
1,"The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book."
0,"This book is essentially the same as ""The Brave New World"" but expressed in a totally different way. Somehow, I like the ""The Brave New World"" better. It gave me a totally different view."
1,"I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
0,i purchased this thinking it was a music video dvd which it is not its more of a documentry with no videos
1,This is really nice to have when you just want something a little different. It makes drinking a cup of coffee step out of the ordinary.
1,"We use Brewers Yeast for added flavor/texture on popcorn and other foods. Kal is the BEST tasting yeast flakes that we have found and the entire family loves it including our two young children. Best of all, it's low fat and very high in important nutrients. We can't seem to get enough of this stuff."
0,"I have never seen the British version, but we liked the American ""Queer as Folk"". It was funny and real. Series 2 is a disappointment, the action seems contrived, and so do the characters. We couldn't believe a minute of it. If you are a fan of the American version you will probably have to have lowered expectations to enjoy this."
1,"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
0,Several of these diapers broke at the side seams causing the gel material to fall out and leave a trail everywhere our toddler went until we finally figured out where it was coming from. Happened with three more diapers in order and after vacuuming for over one our we gave up and tyre the rest out.
0,"This is a good card - if you can not afford the higher priced ones. 64MB DDR, Great - but there are multiple problems with the Gamma. Most of my games need to be touched up a bit by going into the settings and putting the brightness up.I tried to play WarCraft III, Everquest, Age of Mythology and NeverWinter Nights - had problems with all of these games.If you are looking for a good card - to get by on - this is for you.If you are a heavy gamer - DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.Your best bet is to stick with any of the GeForce cards - I just purchased the Xtasy 64MB DDR GeForce 4 card - what a difference....Hope this helps..."
0,"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book."
0,"John Rewald,you should be ashamed.$400 for a lousy 50 color plates(I live in Australia,and it sells for $650).If you're going to put out a catalogue raisonne of an artist,you should have the majority of the works in color,no-one wants to look at b/w reproductions anymore.You just have to compare this with the magnificent catalogue raisonne's on Rothko,Gauguin and Sargent,to see how this work falls short.A major dissappointment."
0,"These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone."
0,I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh
0,"The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
1,"This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948)."
1,"I adore this movie! The actors are phenominal the story is incredible, I don't have a bad thing to say about it. Simply the best telling of this story ever!"
0,"I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!"
0,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
1,"An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after ""Push It"", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. ""Medication"" and ""Hammering in my Head"" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed - especially if you're a garbage fan."
0,"The product is flaky, fragile and small. My son was dissapointed to see just how small and fragile it was. He played with it once and threw in a corner. And he loves boardgames and creative games. I was dissapointd too. I paid too much for too little."
1,This adapter was just what we needed to put new life into our old Mac. The power now stays on to allow for hours of use. It works great! Thanks!
1,"I actually got to enjoy listening to Rebecca in person last month. She is a joy to hear. For being so young she certainly has a presence about her. Even my husband - who isn't necessarily ""into"" Celtic type music truly enjoyed the concert. I purchased her CD at the concert which she graciously signed for me. It is wonderful! ! Something that I will be listening to for a long time to come. I will also be looking forward to her next CD to see how she has grown with her music. I hope that people will give her Cd a try. She truly shines as an artist."
1,Pampers Baby Dry have been our choice for our 2 year old since he outgrew the Swaddlers. We liked the old Cruisers too and we used to switch back and forth between cruisers and baby dry. But I'm not very fond of the new Dry Max Crusiers. So we have started using Pampers Baby Dry exclusively and have been very happy.
0,I am a amazon customer since Aug2010 but i never had this kind of experience that my account is charged several times in a month and same product is dumped into my home.When check with the customer care they are saying i might hit the button several times so my subscription duplicated and hence i am receiving the same product multiple time.I don't know how it is possible.Finally i am able to cancel my account.So be care full when you are subscribing and check you account(credit/debit) attached to the subscription frequently.

0,"Rumor has it that Cinnamon Moonpie (better known as C-Murder) had wanted to title his CD ""Trapped in a Man's Ass"", but his handlers warned that it might dampen sales. They also forced him to change some of the more explicitly homoerotic lyrics into more standard gangsta bling-bling tropes. Personally, I think the original concept would have been a refreshing change of pace. I've been waiting for a long time for a rapper with the guts to admit he's not afraid to love another man in the most intimately physical way. We've known for years about CM's tastes and proclivities, but the hypocrisy of the music biz forces gay rappers to hide their true nature beneath transparent macho posturing, lest they alienate their more dimwitted, less progressive fans. But if you read between the lines, it's pretty clear what they're really on about.Say it loud, say it proud, my beautiful gay black brothers!"
1,The book stays almost unknown in the U.S. only because it provides solid evidences of how aggressive India was. It is an offense to those see China as a demon and India as an angle of democracy.

1,"The ""Texas Beach Music"" we have learned to love has returned in it's full glory with 13 delightful songs! So good to hear the special sounds of the beach on a live CD. Mike nails it when he says in the opening song ""The name (band) has changed but the song remains the same"".Close your eyes, imagine you are in Margaritaville and take a journey to the Gulf Coast, ""Beach People, Beach Music"" will surely take you for a nostalgic journey. The CD has something for everyone, some Buffett cover songs like Pencil Thin Mustache, some beach favorites and some songs that I had not heard before. There is even a song with a strong Cajun flavor and sailing music for those so inclined. Sunday Morning in New Orleans is a smooth ballad that alone is worth the price of the CD.A great band making beautiful ""Beach"" music for all us Buffett/Parrothead/Island people.Billy Peoples AKA The Old parrothead"
0,"I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."
0,"This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."

0,Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.

1,"I've read few dating books from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Author will show you the most common mistakes guys do when dating with women. It really makes dating simple and fun. Thanks Corey!"
0,"IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS BOOK, SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME AND WALK INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC NOW! I was forced to read this book for my english class. It was terrible! Sure the plot line, and even some of the characterization was fine, but MY GOD THE DESCRIPTION goes on and on and on and on. Theres almost 4 pages dedicated to describing a building! If I was given the choice between reading this book, or hitting myself in the head with it for the rest of my life, I would go with the hitting on the head one...becuase i'm sure its even less brain-numbing than Hardy's writing."
1,"Gossip Girl is generally fun and indulgent, however this season sort of has a slow start. Plus the Rufus character is so schleppy I can't help but roll my eyes and think- shave and get a haircut dude. Stop wearing a style that looks like a grown out comb over- trust me I know.. my dad wears it the same way. But Chuck Bass has me hooked, and the fashion is so fun. Roll camera!"
0,"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
1,For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet. Who do we even contact to put in the request?!? I would love this movie on DVD!!!!
1,Absolutely outstanding movie...thought it was better than the Dark Knight 1. I highly recommend this movie. I also love the fact that an on demand Amazon online version came with the movie. I was able to watch the movie instantly without having to wait for it to be delivered (extremely fast I might add).
0,"This lunch box was actually too small and too flimsy to be used as such. My grandson puts Disney miniature cars in it, instead. Once he filled it up, the latch would barely stay closed in order to hold the contents. Basically, it's a cheap piece of metal with Disney Cars painted on it to justify its price."
1,I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
0,Tivo is a great product but this one was defective and I had to send it back and upgrade. Delivery was prompt and product was packed wll.
0,I received this HD DVD twice. Both were defective as neither would even boot.
0,"This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
0,"It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses. The nutdriver is too big for the nut.(The same was true for the other key chain product I bought) I currently use a tweezers to tighten them, which does scratch the glass by the base of the nut. I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers."
0,It's a bummer as initially it worked amazingly well. Started to short out and ultimately failed quickly. Looking for a replacement and am not sure what that will be.
1,"I loved this book! I suggest it for anyone who knows how Brooklyn was at that time.Because both my parents and also two of my grandparents were New York city kids. I am only a 13 year old girl but I have an adult reading level. I think this book had an incredible plot and some of the most wonderfull charecters ever written about. Learning of Francie's life, her thoughts and her pain was incredibly interesting."
1,This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12.
0,"I mean seriously, I paid good money for this book and the practice test answers are wrong. I don't recommend buying this and am going to try and get my money back."
0,The Halti must be correctly sized - and unfortunately the sizing info to determine the correct size is poor. The Holt sizing chart is based on breeds - and didn't work for my mutt. Way too big. Why don't they provide the sizing info based on the circumference of the muzzle and neck?
0,The parts are defective and not what is shown on package. The round top ring that holds the bag ends up being at a 45 degree angle because the side bars are defective. What is seen on package is not what is in package so the final product is not at all what is advertised.
1,I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
1,"While the song selection doesn't allow much room for Clay's awesome glory notes, his amazing voice shines through loud and clear! This album is definitely POP and will forever dispell the Broadway comments often hurled in his direction! Every song on this CD will pull you in...there are no losers here!"
1,"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a ""political"" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the ""deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man"". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."
1,"I love every song. Each song is so unique and versatile in melody that I play it several times a day. Can't seem to get enough of him. Also bought the Christmas cd. Best songs are from Clay and Kelly, all the rest are ok."
0,very badly sized and can't return it since I washed it before trying it on

1,"I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"
1,AWESOME MOVIE!!! Trilling-Action-Packed!! Begins back your childhood!! Love it!!! MUST SEE IT!! GREAT FOR A MOVIE NIGHT FOR FRIENDS OR FAMILY!!!
1,After reading the previous reviews we decided to take a chance and purchase. We're glad we did. The unit is sturdy and solid and it's a bargain compared to others we've seen first hand. Would buy again without question.
1,"This charger only lacks 1 feature from the Apple model: it lack's Apple's green & orange light around the charging tip. To me it's not a big loss, as the light on my Apple charger quit working 2 years ago.I've been using this charger on my 15"" aluminum PowerBook G4 for months, and it has performed exceptionally. The brick does get a little warm, but so does Apple's. I actually prefer this charger over Apple's when traveling, as its longer cord is more functional in airports and hotel rooms. The cord is about the same length as Apple's charger with the extension cord installed, except that it weighs less than half as much and takes up less room in a laptop bag or backpack.I love having an extra charging cable at home so I don't have to play the plug/unplug game every time I move my laptop between rooms. And I prefer this one much more over Apple's when traveling. Highly recommend!"
0,"This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill."
1,"Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed."
1,"Excellent!! Lyrics, melody, heart and that VOICE. I love all of the tracks but ""The Way"" is the best song I've heard in years. It will be a #1 hit for Clay. Thanks Clay!"
1,"I have been in love with this book (and the entire series) since I started reading it when I was eleven, five years ago. Ayla is the ultimate heroine, yet she is totally human, real, and touchable. Auel's extensive research allows her to paint a stunning picture of prehistoric earth. Her characters fit this picture perfectly to tell the amazing story of one young girls life. Malinda Brow"
1,LOVED IT! It was worth the wait. Clay's voice is amazing! I can't wait until his next CD. I especially love Measure of a Man and Invisable...........
1,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is about a girl, named Francie Nolan growing up in the Brooklyn slums in the early 1900's. Her family, which consists of her younger brother Neeley, her father Johnny, and her mother Katie, struggles to make ends meat. Katie ends up being responsible for keeping the family running because Johnny, is an alcoholic and they can't depend on him for survival. The Nolan's are faced with many problems and hardships, but they are strong and always manage to get through them. Life starts to look up for the Nolan's just as they thought all of their dreams would never come true. This is an easy book to get into because it is very discriptive. You feel as if you're a part of the book and that you're living with Francie in the slums of Brooklyn about ninety years ago. This book is a great experience for all who read it."
1,"I received this book from my ex-wife just after our divorce. At first I thought it was a crule joke. But after reading the life 101 book I realized that she could have given me A great gift.. Like the book states, Not all parts will pertain to you at this time, but it is a wonderful refference for later... I have purchased at least 15 of these books. and given them all away.. I usually buy one for myself and start rereading it when someone will say something that relates to a chapter in the book and I point it out to them and the next thing you know there goes another book... at this price it is easy to give them away... MR BILL"
1,"""The Black Arrow"" is R. L. Stevenson at his best. With a smooth, proper style Stevenson creates complex, conflictive characters in an adventure full of emotion and thrills. For anyone who likes adventure, this novel is going to be one of his/her favorites because in this book Stevenson combines beauty with danger."
1,"Well let me tell you I am a big fan of A Charlie Brown Christmas! It just puts you in such a good mood! Charlie Brown the loser we all love to love teaches us the real meaning of Christmas with the help of Snoopy, Lucy and all the gang. This just sums up the happiness that Christmas brings to me... And contains the very cool Snoopy Dance! Check it out to help you get in touch with your inner child and find that holiday spirit!"
0,"My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"
1,"I enjoyed Exit to Eden for the simple reason that I love Anne Rice. But on a more specific note I would say that the character development really pulls you into the mystery of this island paradise/training facility. The subject matter is completely appropriate for the love story which unfolds towards the end of the book.I particularly like the way the book ends for the obvious ""happy ending"" reasons but also for the ""bring you back down to earth"" feeling it leaves you with, after being taken so far from reality it deposits you right back into everday life.Very enjoyable reading. Perfect for the beach or a rainy day."
0,"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself. Search back articles from the Wall Street Journal if you want to read about how the marketing was done. You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."
0,"Good sequal to ""Patton"". Worthy addition to the original. The quality of the dvd however leaves alot to be desired. My copy looks like a copy made from a VHS tape. But, for 1 cent & shipping I guess I can't complain."
0,"Here is a guy with an exceptional voice. What is he doing singing boring, emotionless music that could be sung by countless no talent others on the BMG label. I hope the guys at BMG can rent David Foster to help Clay to get it right next time. Clay could be as good as Michael Buble or Gosh Groban if only he had someone who could bring out his incredbile voice."
1,"The Odyssey was about the greek hero Odysseus' journey home from his victory of the trojan war. He encounters many perils on his voyage. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FANTASY , THIS IS YOUR MOVIE."
1,"I first picked up 'The Satanic Mill' when I was in Primary School. Now, seven years later, the book popped back into my head and I remembered how much I had loved it when I first read it all those years ago. So I bought a copy, and read it - and despite an ice-age of seven years, I still loved it."
0,"The most enduring criticism of ""commercial pop"" music is that by the time the producers get done with their electronica and multiple tracking, the singer gets lost in the shuffle. Such is the case here. The Clay Aiken with the dazzling talent and soaring high notes that we loved on American Idol is buried in a sea of ""production"" so that the album becomes another of so many that literally ""anybody"" could have sung. I guess we'll have to wait until he's proven he can sell enough ""commercial mainstream"" to take the ""risk"" of a ""Broadway"" album, or to sing the the hard-to-sing oldies that he became famous for on AI.Love ya Clay, just not this album."
1,Our son will be getting this for X-mas. He loves crocodiles so we are looking forward to playing it with him.
1,"NEVER had a problem with this device finding a connection, No problems in standby or hibernate mode, or any delays in finding my network.Didn't even need the enclosed drivers.

1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
0,"I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie."
0,"This is just terrible...I bought the CD after hearing ""Chop Suey"" and ""Aerials"" over and over and over again on the radio and thinking that maybe this band had grown up a little bit. But no, it's still mostly pointless thrash to even more pointless lyrics. A few bright spots shine through - ""Atwa"" and ""Toxicity"" actually have melodies, which is a welcome departure from the noise that permeates the rest of the album.I guess it's rough being a heavy metal kid these days. I mean, Tool is practically the only decent band out there, and they don't exactly put out zillions of albums. But there's gotta be something better than Korn and System of a Down, yeesh."
1,"If you enjoy escaping into a world where you can be a witness to adventure, intrigue, romance, acceptance and a bit of magic then this outstanding novel is for you. You arfe able to withdraw from the real world and enter into Grimsley's and Beekman's world. You will be able to become one of the characters of the book, eat with them, ride with them, care about them. I couldn't put it down! Everything was tastefully done, I'd love to read a sequel."
1,Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series.
0,I have been using Pampers Swaddlers size 3 but because of the outrageous price increase I switched to Pampers Dry economy pack......my child's linen is now wet in the mornings and blowouts have been horrible. And now I am stuck with 2 boxes of unusable diapers. How could Pampers sell such an inferior product. I am switching to another brand and another source (such as Costco) from now on.
0,"I waited anxiously and patiently for the video release of Prince Caspian. As someone who has read the whole Narnia series, I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Yeah the special affects were cool, and most kids will probably like the movie. But this movie deviates so far from the original book that it would be easier to list the similarities between the two. Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis' books should not waste their time seeing this."
1,"I loved how this game had number concepts that were beyond just counting skills for young children.I also loved the simple and quick charm that the game had, which reminded me of the games I played as a child. I'm in my 20s and I think this game would be great for when my friends and I want soething to do, but don't want to explain the hard and long rules of the games marketed to our age group."
1,"We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are. It sure makes a great date movie - Under The Tuscan Sun is a marvel!"
1,I love this book. It is some cool. I always look words up whenever I am stumped in music theory or just in my practice. It is a very good buy!! I recommend it to anybody who is into music. :)
1,piper perabo thats all i have to say about this romantic comedy. she is an empowering actress and deserves an academy award nomination. the whole cast is great though. this movie is excellent.
1,"I really like LRD's remix of Cassius's song Feeling for you and this CD is the same style. It does have eighties style digitized rythm and I think its sneaky for him to pose as a French guy (though maybe thats those badboys at Astralwerks) but its a cool disc. You could definitely do worse. Also, it is consistent. So if you like a song you heard somewhere by him, you'll like the album."
0,"The Red Limit is another of Timothy's Ferris excellent distilliations of astrophysics for public consumption. As usual, he is skilled not only in making science concepts comprehensible but bringing into vivid detail the *story* of science -- how we know what we know. It even includes the occasional philosophical discussion.So why the low rating? Because this book is twenty years old. I had assumed that the reprint would maybe have some updated material, but it doesn't. This is effectively a book on the State of Cosmology circa 1983.Don't waste your money on this. Ferris's own Whole Shebang is better written and more up to date. You might also check out Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, which is a very similar book but far better and has been updatee for the most recent discoveries. Bill Bryson's Brief History of Nearly Everything only covers cosmology in basic detail, but is also far more up-to-date."
1,"I was browsing through all the CK albums available and enjoyed the other two reviews of this album. This is just a quick and spontaneous shout out. I just want to say I own over 1,000 CD's from many genres and this is simply, I think, the best one I own...definitely a ""desert-island disc"" if there ever was one. You know, the music you would take if your were stranded forever on a desert island.I Love Everything About This Album. Songs, production AND CHAKA! The initial single was ""Got to be There"" and it is just a gem and a half. For a real throwdown, however, there is the opening track ""Tearin' It Up"" and it really does tear it up.If you can find this album JUMP ON IT...believe it or not I got mine in a little used CD shop for $4.99 and it's the Japanese Import version. It's the same as the US release but it's kinda fun to see the liner notes in 2 languages."
1,"I use Baby Dry in size 4 for my 18 month old son. He has yet to have even ONE blow out diaper, even though he has had some tummy issues due to antibiotics. They are comfortable and fit his chunky thighs well. I've never had a leak either, even though he has some pretty full diapers in the morning."
0,Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster. I paid around 39 for it and see it's now retailing for 9. It just doesn't work. It's a pathetic toy. However I got in touch with Mattel and on the second attempt (they didn't respond first time or didn't get my e-mail) they phoned to offer me a choice of replacement toys. Hope everyone here has done this or will do it - complaining is the only way toy manufacturers will learn.
1,I loved it!!! If you loved The Secret (and Julie Garwoods other medieval stories) you will love this one just as much-- or more. You can't help but read it all at once. It's too good to put down and totally worth feeling sleepy over the next morning because you couldn't. I can't wait to see who's story we get next....
1,"Quite possibly one of the best books ever written. The first time I read this book I was incredibly sick and promised myself (at about 7 pm) that I would read just 1 or 2 chapters and get to bed. At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept. This book is surreal, empowering and cathartic all at the same time. It brings mythical characters who often feel cold and drab in mere textbook descriptions to life as utterly human, modern characters with a depth of feeling and thought beyond the scope of that captured in most novels."
0,"I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."
0,"FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."
1,"I just finished reading ""100 Years of Solitude"". I really enjoyed it, tho it took me 3 weeks to read it. Everytime I opened it back up to continue where I was I felt like I was stepping back into Macondo. There's no place like it nor is there a family like the Buendia's either. The story and the words used by Marquez are so deep in meaning and a sentence can mean so many things. I loved it and I love the twists and turns the family goes thru like any family. However, I knew what was going to happen in the end, which was really kinda ironic and funny. You have to read to find out."
0,"Why is it every album up for review on AMZN has a 4+ feedback level? It's an anomaly of our era I guess. Which makes it all the tougher to discern the true artistic gems from the abundance of turds shat by the corporate oligarchy. These guys have litle to say and it shows. The rifts are half-assed catchy and that is the extent of their offering. Damn, the mediocrity that is heralded as the 2nd coming of Jesus is becoming quite tiring!"
0,"As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money."

1,"The music of Mercan Dede, or with his other name DJ Alan Arkin, is taking us to a travel in the land of Sufism. I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song ""Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi"", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. ""Walking on the Red Sea"", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do."

0,"This book seemed like just another rehash of the basic training storyline from Starship Troopers. But there's less to it than in Starship Troopers. I don't like the characters. The only one that says anything other than the ""gee shucks, we're in the space patrol"" line is an utter creep and many of the scenes just drag along. I heard that kids have liked this book and it seems more written for teenagers than adults, but there's not a lot to recommend. Only in the last 30 pages does the book pick up and start doing things, but up until then it's training, training and more training.For better Heinlein books of this style try either Starship Troopers or Podkyne of Mars."

1,"The antenna, while being a bit large, does work rather well. It is highly directional so you will have to move it around somewhat. It is styled well and sturdy. I have it sitting on top of my sat receiver and it looks good where it sits. This antenna, by the way, is built by Winegauard, a longtime American antenna company."
1,"To those of u who critize this album, you haven't heard him since these songs in person! His voice is so powerful I can see why Randy said ""where is that voice coming from"". The Way is great as is Touch. Invisible is catchy and is what he is identified with.He sings beautifully - so talented - and will be around for a long time. Go see him!!!"
0,Dvd was dissapointing. It was not a 2007 concert as you could be lead to believe on the way the dvd is advertised.The dvd was released in 2007 but was of a 1982 concert. Parts of the sound track are not in sinc with the video.
1,"I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
0,"This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it. No scares, no suspense, nuthin. Rock bottom."
1,"For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
1,"I confess, I was somewhat skeptical of the talents of a 14 yr. old girl...but I pretty much had my socks blown off when I heard Stacie's CD. It's a great listen, and will have you dancing in front of your mirror and singing along after the first listen-through. The catchy lyrics and R&B rhythms are fantastic and the songs really reflect well the conflicts of a teenage girl who has a relationship with God...she's not just singing about stuff she can't relate to. I'd recommend this to anyone."
1,This book has informed me of things I have never known. I watch a lot of crime shows but Mark and John go behind the scenes and explain how the actual process works. The difficulties of solving a crime and making sure you have the right person. Very interesting read. Could not put it down.
0,"I recently got a Kindle, so I started looking for books to put in to it. Walt Whitman's ""Leaves of Grass"" is an old favorite of mine, so I looked for Kindle editions. There were 31 matches to my search, though not all of them are the actual book of poems. My complaints about this offering start with the absence of a table of contents. Whitman didn't title the poems in the original 1855 edition, though he did in subsequent editions, but a table of contents could show the first line of each poem. Beyond the lack of TOC, the edition is not identified nor is the ""publisher,"" which makes it difficult, though not impossible, to associate a rating with a specific offering."
1,"I've always like VH-1's Classic Albums series and this episode doesn't disappoint. Great interviews with Robbie, Levon, and other band members (Including Rick Danko, who died last December). I love how they broke down Rag Momma Rag and Rockin' Chair into it's separate parts. A must for all Band Fans."
0,"Better than the previous one (""Body in the Basement"")--Faith is just more interesting than Pix--but Page went back to the whole Faith and Tom don't seem to like their kids and shouldn't be parents thing, which is annoying. Faith is also a bit snobby.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
1,If you want to hear good music just listen to this cd. I have had it since two thousand and it is still the best cd I own. He is truly the best R&B artist ever. Usher you don't have a chance in competing with the man known as R.Kelly.
1,"In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like ""Close to You"" and ""Night and Day"" to more festive songs like ""Cadaca"" and the great ""Os Novos Yorkinos"" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."
1,"I was hesitant to do digital purchase. But 3 months later, still good. Have watched it 4+ times and still have option of porting it to two different devices. A great movie to own and watch again and again."
1,"A DJ aquaintance of mine told me that 'Arular' always got the crowd up and dancing, and in a way, I can see why. Central to this electronic beatfest is M.I.A's sassy vocals, falling somewhere in between Madonna and Lene Lovich (the Neneh Cherry comparison is pretty good) all within the framework of hip-hop rhyming. There's really no need to over-analyze the music, which is basically infectious stripped-down beats, eg, LCD Soundsystem, pulsating, raw and tribal, almost hailing back to the crushing barebones approach of early hip-hop, eg, Grandmaster Flash. Also thrown into the mix is a subtle yet ecclectic fusion of analog flash, dancehall, and world music. But basically the appeal of 'Arular' stems from the charm and sexuality of M.I.A's vocals, orgasmic shrieks and brassy chants, a female touch when one expects male vocals to compliment the rhythmic thunder. Here she is now, let M.I.A. entertain you."
0,"Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."
1,"A novel, and fresh approach to explaining the wants, wishes, desires, expectations and behaviour of fictional AUstralian tourists in various parts of the world. Its as much about travel, as the human condition. A wonderful book, and explains alot about the tourist mentality."
1,This is an awesome product it charges super fast. I dont know what the other reviewer is talking about i can get 2 charges out of this even when i use my extended iPpod battery this is one product every person with an ipod should have.
0,Strange analogy on death. I tried to go find good in this rambling read but non exist. No need to bother.
1,"This book made me laugh so hard I was literally gasping for air. It totally hits a satirical bullseye and could not be more timely. I am giving it to everyone on my Christmas list.I found it hard to believe that ""Who Moved My Soap"" could live up to the rave reviews I'd read of it, but it does, and then some. Pick it up and see for yourself - you will be very, very happy you did."
1,"The TiVo adapter is practically effortless to install. Once installed, the TiVo Series2 recognizes the adapter easily, then you can walk through the configuration to set it up on the wireless network. The only challenging part is the cumbersome entry of the SSID, due to the TiVo interface for text entry. But once it was configured, it connected OK and is far superior to using the phone line by any means."
0,"I enjoyed the first hundred pages or so. The symbolism was very intriguing, but after a while it was just confusing with too many characters and a meandering plot. I could not stay awake long enough to finish it."
0,"In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight."
1,I bought this for our whole house stereo speakers (7 different rooms plus our back patio). It works really well and creates less heat in the cabinet then our older version of this amp.

0,"This is an absolute waste of paper and money. There are very few interesting facts, historical or other wise, about redheads in this book. It is mostly overly wordy personal anecdotes of the author.Let me stress the overly wordy part.I'm still looking for that book that I had hoped this one was...you know the one about the myths, beliefs, facts, etc of redheads...of which I am proudly one..."
1,I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
1,"I love all the songs on the album and its a great first album. I feel the song ""touch"" is probably my favorite and then the next would be ""The Way"" and both would do very well on the charts if released as a single. Clay definitely does sound different than A I and in some aspects I miss that amazing vocal range he has which is clearly not expressed as much on his debut CD. All and all the CD is very good but I hope for this next album there are songs that have more of a range in them."
1,"The shoe rack is good. It looks nice and easy to assemble. It is also easy to adjust according to the shoe sizes.I have couple of concerns. One - As other people have mentioned, it is not very easy to put on the big shoes. It is very comfortable to put in my kids and my wife shoes. However, when I hang my shoes, I have literally squeeze them in. Second - When you put all the shoes, you will see the back of the shoes for the ones hanging on the front. The pictures never show the tree with all the shoes filled in, so I never realized that it does not look as beautiful as shown in the pictures."
0,"This is the story of a group of children left to survive on their own after a virus (hence the series title ""fire-us"" - which is virus in baby-speak)has killed most of the human population.Some parts of the story are interesting. One of the older kids, Hunter, spends a great deal of time searching for food in old stores and houses. The dialogue between the kids, however, is tedious and boring. It is also very difficult to believe that children would end up acting the way the main characters do in this story.If you want to read really good survival stories, then try reading Philbrick's Last Book in the Universe or Robert Swindells' Brother in the Land."
0,"I would rather eat sticks or leaves from my yard. The noodles are awful, the broth is typical ramen broth. I bought a three cases of these because Nissin Choice ramen was discontinued at the supermarket and I wanted something a little more healthy because I eat ramen for breakfast often.I told my four coworkers I was going to throw out all the ramen and they all tried a packet. They all agreed it was the worst ramen they had ever tasted by far and wouldn't take it for free. I think I am going to donate it to the food bank, pity the homeless."
0,"If you're a Heaven 17 fan, you're gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you're gonna be disappointed. It's just plain rubbish. There are one or two tracks that *might* warrant a second listening, but overall, the CD is annoying and a waste of money. Most of tracks have very little unity between H17 and the dance track, sounding like two songs mistakenly played together."
0,"Discovery Kid's products are designed to ""look cool"" in the box but they are cheap plastic junk. They break. What's worse is the manual states that they are warranted by Discovery Store Inc. but if you do not buy direct from Discovery Store, they will NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY!!! So what happens? You buy your kid a cool toy. They use it for a few weeks. Then it breaks. You have crying kids. You call Discovery. You don't have an order number, they tell you to get lost.Don't buy this junk. It is guaranteed to break. Shop around and find something that is hobby quality or just select a different gift for you kid."
1,"Kenichi is definitely worth buying. It's full of humor and action, and who doesn't think that a guying being shown up by a female martial artist is funny."
0,"The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues."
1,"I tried Swaddlers, Huggies Snug N Dry and this one.1. Huggies and Baby Dry are functionally equivalent but not as good as swaddlers. This one is softer than Huggies.2. Not as good and leak proof as Pampers Swaddlers.Verdict: Buy Swaddlers upto size 2 and then switch to this one from size 3."
0,"This book was a disappointment in comparison to other Crusie books. Her books were my first foray into contemporary romance. The plot is not too developed or very interesting for that matter. And the main characters, they come off pretty flat."
0,"Rollerball in name only. While the original 1975 production was intelligent Science Fiction mixed with action and a touch of intrigue this sequel is nothing but garbage. To compare the two is like saying the first was a Rembrandt while this is urban scrawled graffiti.A great movie from 1975 dumbed down to suit the ethnically urbanized pseudo gangsters that make up the majority of todays youth sub culture. There's good reason that there are hundreds of this Rollerball movie being sold for a penny on Amazon and Ebay while the 1975 version still demands a fair price.Talk about living in a dystopic future society. With movies coming out that cater only to the sub culture niche of wanna be ""gangsta's"" and their hip hop mentality, it's becoming obvious that we ARE living in a dystopic society. This movie was trash."
0,"I expected that this book would be wonderful. Many friends urged me to read it and so I did - up to page 168. I think I just don't get it. I began to get sea sick from being at times engaged in the story to next wondering what the point of reading it was. War after war, sex after sex, baby after baby.... it got old and so I gave up. Hooray for all who get the beauty of the story and enjoy it. I wish I had been able. Next....."
0,"This movie was not very good. It seemed like a low budget made for 3rd world TV production. The planes were hoaky and most were the wrong type for the time periods portrayed in the story. The story of the Red Baron was incorrect as well, and the ending was totally wrong. For a movie about history it was way off base."

Snoop is just hall passing these days so him being on cruise control here comes as no suprise."

1,"Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!"

0,"Wow, after reading all the rave reviews here I expected a great rice cooker. It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my ""cheap"" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money. Will be sending this back asap."
1,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! So what if it's not the game! I'm just unhappy they did a crappy soundtrack. I had to buy a bootleg cd to get Alan Silvestri's score. The movie had its parts just for kids, but I am 15 years old and I still want a pair of those cool boots! I wish there was a DVD, too. When I first saw this movie, I hoped there would be a sequel, and I still want Super Mario Breothers Part II. Those of you who hate this movie wiil probably grow up to be critics, like another reviewer said. Critics usually hate the best movies. They hated this, The Goonies, Jurassic Park, Blues Brothers, etc., and these are great movies.Take a look after the credits for a surprise from the Super Koopa Cousins!"
1,"If you have lived in Germany, you would have heard about PUR. Their music is catchy with great lyrics and very easy to listen to - even my children (young and do not speak German) love the music. You do not have to understand a word of German to enjoy this CD and any one of their CD's. Best track in my opinion on this CD has got to be "" Hor Gut Zu"""
0,"This book was hard to read from the start. Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly. The copy I read was from the library, and there were mispelled sticky notes throughout with what looked like two middle schoolers trying to figure out what was going on. (For instance, ""Why is Beatty ask about the dog? Dose he know where the books are?"")The ending is alright, and I really liked the quote about how the inability to build creates a need to destroy."
0,It doesn't show anywhere (that I could see) that this is only one canvas. Very misleading description. I wish I had read all the reviews before ordering!
0,"I was just about to buy this book for my child bearing friend when I saw the outdated view to homosexuality. Pitty. This book is very good in many espects; but in the event of the child or anyone close to the family being homosexual, this will probably result in parent's mishandling of the situation which will perhaps do a good deal of damage to the child's self esteem."
0,I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey.

There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump"
1,The only feature missing from the Apple version of this is the light in the plug tip that confirms it is seated well and shows the charging status. I can live without it for the $70 I saved.
1,Austin brings to life a part of the gospel many wish to skip over. The horror of idolatry is described in ways many refuse to visualize because of the horror that is involved. This is a wonderful portrayal of this dark time in Israel's history and the beginning of the glorious rising out of the darkness of sin.
1,"I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can! Special effects are amazing, however the story line is weak compared to the first two movies. I was a little disappointed by the story and this is my least favorite installment. Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete."
0,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond, by Elizabeth George Speare, was filled with excitement. The only reason I gave this book 1 star was I always compare it to the French classic Gravybleu. I liked a lot though, more than my usual books; Hamington Road and the most recent Loolystolu. I loved this book because I sort of learned about America. I am glad I was able to share this to the world...because this was my only dream...to share my feelings to American kids!! Thankyou and read it! :)"
0,The package contained just one stretched canvas and not 6 as the description claims. I had to return this order as Amazon cannot replace it for some reasons which made a lousy non-Christmas present and I have no refund 6 weeks to-date..

0,"'Herland' is hardly a cracking read, but it's interesting as a feminist-historical text. It's worth reading, but for the love of Mike get a different edition. This cover is utterly hideous and completely at odds with the ethos of the story. Why would a female-only society, where dress is utilitarian and reproduction asexual, tart themselves up in pink eyeshadow and mascara that would make even an overly-flamboyant drag queen quail?"
0,iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well.
1,"One of my favorite of Gord's albums because he's singing his heart even more than usual.Nothing commercial going on here; no pop tunes, no overt attempts at a single. Instead, the best collection of lyrics Gord ever put on a single album. Each song evokes a particular mood; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.More than any other GL album, this one makes me feel like I know him."
1,"After I heard Cheatin' from the Shaft soundtrack, I couldn't wait for Liberty City album to drop. This group has talent! The song line-up on this album is very good and the way their voices harmoniously flow togehter makes for a smooth and easy sound."
0,I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
0,"I generally enjoy watching old movies, but this is not one of the good ones. While Hitchcock managed a few decent movies, I think he was LARGELY overrated.The story is thin, attempted humor is more annoying than funny (as is Peter Lorre), in general the writing is bad and the acting not so great. Our war spies end up getting credit for a job they couldn't/didn't even do - they were pathetic and so was the whole setup which makes the USA look foolish and incompetent. In fact, the more I think about this movie after watching it, the more I dislike it.I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. Sorry."
1,"I know the members of the band and they're some of the greatest people out there and they're music is to match. William Goldsmith's drumming is amazing and his energy is not to be beat. Anyone who says that they're too quiet don't know anything about quality. This is quality few ever hear in music.They are talented and emotional and willing to experiment. More experiments with intense, emotional music will be on the next album. If you like this, check out Diary and the Pink Album."
1,"Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume."
1,TP-2.com is probably the greatest cd's that I own. I have had the album for 4 years and I am listening to it as i speak. Its a cd that i can never live without again. R.Kelly is a genuis and I believe i can go out on a huge limb and say he maybe the top 3 or 4 best R&B artist ever. I can't wait for his new album TP-3 reloaded.
0,The author reviews mathematical history but mentions no India nor China. He presented a biased view of mathematical history.The books is misleading in that regard.
1,"I got this book, because I wanted to gain a greater understanding of Process Theism. I was familiar with free will theism, but certain aspects of it were troubling to me. While I find myself disagreeing with some of what process theologians have to say, it has been extremely helpful for me in clarifying my own viewpoint. I enjoyed the debate format that gave others a chance to respond and point out weak points and strong points in each of the articles."

0,"I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
1,"Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn."
0,"I have the Le Mystere Safari T-Shirt Bra and love it, but this bra is just not as good. The quality is not great; the fabric is harsh and the cups of the bra are very stiff. When I tried it on, the bra separated my boobs very far apart. It made me look like a 1950's housewife with cone boobs. No cleavage, total separation, very pointy. Just not attractive.As for the sizing, I didn't feel that the cups were too small. I am a 32 G in other Le Mystere bras and the fit was proportional. The cups just made my chest look unattractive."

1,"An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible ""players"". Don't try this one at home!"
1,I really loved this book! It has my second favorite pair of soulmates in it (Ash & Mary-Lynette being my favorite). This book reminds me a lot of my favorite show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I think they even mention the movie in the book... Anyway this book up there with my top 5 favorite L. J. Smith books. They are all so good that it is hard to decide an exact order. so if you haven't read it yet then I suggest that you do.
1,"This was recommended to a friend of mine by his doctor. I'm usually very skeptical of herbal treatments, but since the recommendation came from a regular medical doctor, I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by the results. I have been on this product for about 18 months, and my cholesterol has dropped from 252 to 192. I made no other significant changes in my diet. What's more, I am only taking two capsules a day instead of the recommended dosage of four per day. I've read that the big pharmaceuticals are campaigning to require this product to be sold only by prescription. I pray this never happens."
1,"Mack Bolan is back,tough and cool,in the second book of the Four Horsemen Trilogy. Bolan takes on a cult,bikers and terrorists. The Millennium angle, adds a fresh and current depth to the book.The ending is exciting and intense. Mike Newton writes another atmospheric Bolan novel, that works. Check it out."

Thak you!

1,"I'm not a huge fan of Elton John, but I loved this CD! I was hoping for more of the music from the movie itself, especially the Kline/Branagh version of ""It's Tough to Be A God"", but I was very happy with what I got. I do hope that Dreamworks releases another CD, with more of the score and the Kline/Branagh song, but I'm still very happy with this cd."
0,"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character. I'm just glad I got this used for six bucks and not the twenty-five amazon is asking for it"
1,Simple to install. No reception problems so far. (My router is upstairs and the adapter is downstairs.) Had it 3-4 weeks now. Much cheaper through Amazon than to get it directly from TiVo.
0,"This film is not worth the shipping and handling. George C. Scott gives a fabulous performance of a simply miserable script. The production values rival a poor film school project. The supplementary characters are obtuse and poorly developed; Patton's wife is both whiny and soporific. If you're a fan of the original, then you'll hate this. If you crave a ""Lifetime Original,"" then I suggest this movie."
0,New 2575 Christmas 2005. HP rep in CompUSA approached me when I was in to get a Lexmark cartridge for my old printer. Short sales pitch later I walked out with a new HP 2575. It printed only 160 sheets before paper feed failed. HP sent a replacement under warranty. The replacement printed 262 sheets before the same problem emerged. Never abused or jammed. Used only HP paper. Stay away from this one. Read the other emails. Clearly a design defect. Sure wish I hadn't tossed that Lexmark out.
0,I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. They did not fit very well and were very loose. I use the small size and they did not fit very well. The medium and large size do not fit my ear canal. Too bad as I need an in-ear bluetooth to hear well. I guess I will have to look for something else.
1,"One of the most wonderful jazz CD's I've purchased in the last few years. Ms. McRae takes the genius of Monk, removes the edginess without detracting from the spirit of the music, and rolls out knock-out after knock-out. I wouldn't have thought it possible, frankly. The supporting quartet is terrific. I can't imagine any true jazz lover being disappointed in this CD."
0,"If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them. This movie was not scary. It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters. You know what the best part was? When it was over.Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad. This one obviously did."
1,"This album always has been essential in a tecno pop collection and it reachs its madurity with the DTS mix.Gosh, it seems to listened to new a thing. I was so used to listen to this record with the originally hoarse sound. Like if you put your speakers facing to the floor. But now it's so clean so when you listen to it new sounds come up like if they never have been there before.Such a nice experience. Sit in middle of those 5 speakers and you won't regret it.There is only one thing I would have change. I now the originally lp press came out without the bonus tracks but, since everybody is used to the cd version, they should have put the whole tracks together and not separated, so in order to play them you have to get into a new menu.Enjoy it while it last."

1,"I read the first Joshua book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would recommend reading it prior to reading this book. In contrast to the first book, I agree with one of the other readers in that the author was much kinder toward organized religion this time which made it a little easier to swallow. However, Joshua was much more open and obvious with his working of miracles which made the book much less believeable. In the first book most of the characters were left guessing as to who Joshua truly was and his message was expressed in very subtle ways. This time his actions made his identity obvious and the characters either believed immediately or were fools. Overall this was a good book."
1,"A well-crafted, sharp-witted tale that will be especially appealing to anyone who has ever read Tolkien and his ilk. Discworld is at once absurd and complex, yet held against the fabric of our reality, it's just as plausible. I'm hard pressed to think of a more likable character than Corporal Carrot. The modest anti-gun message was subtle enough to remain unobtrusive."
1,"Loved it! Gives you great insight on the fundamentals of living a progressive life, ""The ultimate self-help book,"" even for those not seeking one"""
1,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."
1,"This beauty and cute book is the best for catlover!Stunning photos, easy to read colour charts, a lot of informations also regarding the cats...and wonder projects to stitch!I can't wait to stitch all this beauty pussycats!"
0,"This book professes to be for all people, but is in fact, just for the devoutly religious. I could not finish it because it was so faith based, it made me sick to my stomach. Maybe some people can just give over control of their lives to God, but I cannot. I don't think that the reason for anger is our sins, as the previous reviewer has written, but I do think this book is deceptive. Nowhere on the cover does it mention that this book will try to get you to give your anger over to God and let him take care of you, but that is exactly what this book tells you. It is a total waste of money."
0,"Batman Begins would've been a better movie had it been it's own original character. Although comical at times and the constant changing lead actors playing Batman (i.e. Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer & George Clooney), the consistency was there. Batman Begins and doesn't quite offer an insight as to what you're watching. Is he in Tibet? Okay, halfway in you find out why he was locked up. Batman Begins tried to be darker than it was. The unimpressive BatMobile (Hummer, dune buggie dragster fusion). Maybe the new generation of kids will enjoy this. But as a new twist on Batman, 2 stars. As a standalone hero, Begins would deserve maybe 4 stars."
1,I had been looking for a spare set of flannel sheets for my bed. These are not the best but they certainly are good enough. They are a bit thin but soft and warm. I do recommend them.
1,"Alfie is another british band with an unexplainable amount of talent. Unexplainable because it seems most british groups are ingenious in their own way. Where did they get it from? Who knows? But i do know that us rebels over here in the beautiful u.s., took only a bit of that musical ingenuity when crossing the big pond back in the day. Okay, all gawking aside, i must admit that alfie's lead singer reminds me slightly of the lead singer of ""they might be giants"". That's a good thing if you like (or can tolerate) ""they might be giants"". Luckily i grew up listening to my sisters collection of music, and t.m.b.g. happened to be in the mix. So alfie, like you might expect, is ingenious (on tracks 2 & 3 inparticular) and a bit quirky (especially the vocals(all tracks)). But don't buy this album because you want good, strange music, buy it because it's good, mellow music with great instrumentation and a unique sound."
0,"Deodorant control works by gluing you pits shut. Seriously, this stuff was sticky and nasty."
1,I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.
1,"This was a very good book, while not excellent. The characters, mostly Bess, were somewhat superficial and shallow, but this got better as the book progressed. As far as I am concerned, the only problem was the author's tendency to write page-long narratives of Bess's slightly maundering thoughts, which were fairly uninteresting and repetitive. But, as I said, it got much better by the end, and the final conclusion was very emotionally moving (I cried), even though anyone who's read Alfred Noyes' ""The Highwayman"" knew what would happen.The author is excellent at writing dark, emotional endings, and she used this ability to the full in this book. While there are the aforementioned problems, it's most definitely a page-turner, and if you like ""The Highwayman"" at all, you're pretty much guaranteed to like ""Watch by Moonlight"". It's not the sort of book you keep under your pillow and memorize, but it's a very good read even the second and third time."
0,Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
1,This is one CD that I can listen over and over again and still get chills. CLAY Aiken Has a God given Gift He is amazingly talented and very Sexy. For the Person who was negative about Him just to boost Taylor Hicks and His CD there is no need to bash the True American Idol Clay Aiken just to get Your point for Taylor accross. I too Love Taylor I was part of the soul patrol and I do have Under the Radar and while it's ok it pales in any comparison to any of Clays CD's. Buy Measure of A Man and any CD Clay records You won't be sorry. He is amazing.
1,"I was very upset when they took this series off the air. I'm glad to have these movies but still wish the series was still around, Love this movie."
1,"When he made this album, John Coltrane considered it to be his gift to God. It's certainly worthy of that status, having some really amazing instrumentals, including, of course, John Coltrane's masterful saxaphone playing. I'm a drummer, and I can testify that this album is also a prime example of really skillful jazz percussion. If you're looking to start a really fine jazz collection, this would be an important album to include.If you liked this, I recommend Coltrane's ""Giant Steps."" It's a little bit less serious, slightly more bouncy, but of similar excellence."
0,"""ChiRunning"" is not a new idea. This running method has beendescribed and advocated by Dr.Nicholas Romanov since 1977 as a pose method of running. Visit his website; [...]. It is very annoying to see the description of ""ChiRunning"" a revolutionary idea by simply attaching ""Chi"" to the pose method [...]. ""Chi"" part of this book is very superficial."

0,"I usually love Pampers, but the Baby Dry Pampers really irritated my little boy's skin. He didn't have any leaks but the angry red marks on his skin negated the leak free aspect. If your baby's skin isn't super sensitive, these would be great but if your little one has sensitive skin, skip these and go for the Swaddlers."
1,I have used this product in the past with great success. I ordered more because I had misplaced my original one.
1,Overall its an informative book well worth reading so I give it 5 stars. He rehashes the virgo thing to death throughout the book where I felt he could have laid that out better in 1 or 2 chapters.Also as mentioned by others below he left alot of Masonic stuff out.I recommend watching on video AMERICAS SECRET DESTINY and RIDDLES IN STONE they add and parallel this book quite well.

0,"The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
1,"I LOVE Crocodile Creek Lunchboxes! They are perfect for Kindergarten and 1st Grade children since they don't require as much lunch as an older child may. It can even hold a thermos drink cup or soup cup.This lunchbox has held up wonderfully thru an entire year of daily lunches, being thrown around in class, smashed in packpacks and drug across lunch tables. I highly recommend this product to anyone with younger children."
0,The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers.
1,"I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
0,"I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
1,"saw this on the chris matthews show and ordered it immediately. when it arrived at thanksgiving time, it took two days before i was able to view it--everyone else was reading it and walking off with it. for those of us who were virtually in a state of shock for the first week after 9-11, it is wonderful to be able to view this collection of work. beautifully done, i was at once both grieving at the event yet so very proud to be an american.enough said."
1,"I had read the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20's. The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more."

0,I'm not sure what zombie movies the other reviewers have watched but I find it hard to believe they actually liked this one. I feel like I was tricked into paying for this based on the reviews.

1,"The book was in perfect condition, however, it didn't come with the user access code for internet review websites."
1,"This is a great little book on purity. I read it in an hour and couldn't put it down. ""The Purity Principle"" gets ""in your face"" on the issue of sexual purity, speaking directly, but not inappropriately about the slippery slope that is sexual sin and practical ways to combat it. The engaging message was so vivid and powerful that I immediately ordered two additional copies so that each of my sons could have their own.My one reservation about this book is that it does not give enough help and hope to the person who has already seriously fallen and needs help getting on the right track. I am concerned that such a person, rather than seeing the power of a gracious God to restore them, might feel that they are too far gone for a meaningful recovery after reading this book."
0,"I cannot believe I paid so much for a camcorder that has such a JUNKIE battery charger built in. If it gets bumped even slightly, or has too much pressure on the cord just laying there, it comes out. You pick up a camera thinking it is charged, and find out it is NOT!! Bought before going on vacation, & called the store upon my return to complain. They said, ""That is just Sony's way of making you buy a separate charger."" After several months of hassles, I notified Sony about my dissatisfaction with this, & their customer service rep sent me a smart-alec reply by e-mail. Won't buy another Sony product if that is how they take care of customers. Sandy"

1,I would definately recommend this product to anyone with a Tivo set who wants to use their broadband instead of a phone line to update Tivo. It was very easy to install. Took me about 10 minutes and I was up and running. I've had it for a couple of months now and never had any problems. It always stays connected.
1,"Bought this for my Dad, as I have come to love having my revolver in an ankle holster. He uses it for his .38 Special. There's nothing fancy here, which is why the price is low. But that doesn't mean that it's ""cheap"" either. It is just a good product at a good price.Recommended for anyone looking. Also, my Dad is 5'6"", I am 6'2"" and this fits both of us equally well. Didn't try it on my 8 year old, but I'm sure it would fit, it's quite adjustable."

Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!"
0,"I was completely disappointed in this ""film.""This film was LITERALLY put together by Spongebob Squarepants studio assistants and was a complete waste of my evening. Not funny, not humerous (other than 4 lesbian high-schoolers and the main character's ex-boyfriend who is friggin' hilarious in the few scenes he is in), and nauseatingly slow-paced.I won't go into a long description, but essentially, some girl is totally obsessed with Moz and stops by some of his old haunts in an effort to find and marry him. She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it. You will be disappointed. And remember, MOZ IS NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!"
1,"And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS."
1,"Martnez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalb evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure."

1,"I'm planning on loaning this book out to some of my Protestant friends who have misconceptions about Catholicism. Mr. Schreck successfully refutes such notions as ""the Catholic Church puts its own hierarchy above scripture,"" ""the Catholic Church teaches Pelagian works righteousness,"" and ""Catholics deify Mary and the Saints."" Mr. Schreck has done an excellent job of stating what Catholics really believe, as well as presenting the Scriptural foundations of those beliefs."
0,"The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."

0,"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."

1,"I didn't expect much from this book, the reviews weren't great. I liked it a lot. I bought the book some time ago and hadn't gotten around to it because of the reviews. When I sat down and started reading I finished it which frankly is unusual for an Anne Perry book. I like her writing but sometimes it doesn't grab me right away. This book did grab me and I remain a devoted fan of Ms. Perry. I have ordered her next book and will not let it sit on the shelf before reading it."

I am quite bitter, becuase I am trying to use this miserable excuse for toilet paper to prep for an exam two days from now. It at least reassures me of how much I do know because all the errors are so glaring. I think that perhaps this author should also advertise that they got their Ph.D. out of a cracker jack box. I will be writing to Princeton Review to demand my money back, and I urge University Chemistry departments everywhere to warn students about this book. Honestly, a retarded monkey with no limbs could write a better book. I wonder what Laberge got on the Chem GRE?"
0,"While I love a few tracks on this CD and admire the writers and producers involved (Darren Hayes, Desmond Child, Cathy Dennis, Danielle Brisbois, Aldo Nova), almost every song sounds the same.

I definetly like Clay's voice and there are standout songs that actually effected me (the title track especially moved me) but I have to say Kelly Clarkson's debut CD is head and shoulders a better produced collection than this middle of the road, unoffensive, generic collection of milquetoast. I expected more from Clay after his first single. Better luck next time."
1,"This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."

0,"I purchased the Pampers Baby Dry by mistake and I hated them. They leak and they are hard. Pampers Swaddlers are excellent they NEVER leak, they are soft and comfortable for my baby boy. Stick with the Swaddlers or you'll not only be changing the babies diaper more often but you'll be changing the babies clothes and bedding too."
0,"This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it."

Pointless, which school teachers of little old scotland make you read. If we have to burn books I put this one up to get burned straight away."
1,"What a book!!! Hard to believe you can break down one weekend and make it so fascinating! Made me want to go get a job at the USGA! What a great read, good flow, great humor but not over the top, good storyline, great characters...and it's all true!!!GREAT BOOK!!!"
1,"I got this book for free as a limited-time offer for Kindle, so I might be a little biased. That being said, I still think it's worth either buying or renting from the library. What's unique about it is that it is largely told from the first-person perspective of Lewis, an American college student studying at Oxford University in the UK. Lewis, following after his friend Simon, enters into the world of Albion which is styled after Celtic history and mythology. Many people are opposed to the book because of its Christian themes but I would say give it try anyway. It's a refreshing and unique take on historical fantasy."
1,"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play. By no means would I considered myself a ""literary expert,"" but this was very readable and you can pull a lot of the deeper meanings and its context in Russian history by yourself. I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I. While it may be set in the tumultuous period prior to the Russian revolution, the ideas and the discussions this play provokes are timeless.Highly recommended!"

0,"After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"
1,Not your typical high school gay movie. It is well acted and very interesting. Would recommend it to anyone that is into stuff like this.

0,"This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
1,Altho I Like Ruben very much I was disappointed that Clay did not win top billing on American Idol. I eagerly awaited the release of this album and I was worried when I heard the first critics opinions. They talked of how boring it was. I bought it anyway and I havent regretted it from the very first time I played it. I cant say that there is a song on this album that I dont like and the more I play it the better it gets. I can only see Clay getting better from here as he got better with each and every American Idol Show. If you like Clays voice this album is a must have and play it often to get the full pleasure from it. It definitely Gets Better Every Time!
1,"A classic movie, still spooky after all these years. You can see the difference between good and evil through-out this film."
0,"If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet."
1,"and one of the most distinctive and beautiful albums in the history of rock music.i won't even attempt to describe this album, other than that if you're at all turned off by the screaming - don't worry. something about this cd voids that screaming down to just music. it's more ""shouting"" rather than screaming, if you know what i mean...it's just an incredibly beautiful cd, but it is the epitome of the ""let it sink in"" album.you most likely will not like this album the first time you hear it, almsot definitely if you're already in no way familiar with them, but it will sink in. it isn't silly, this is emotional music. it's beautiful and deep music. it's art in a very unpretentious honest way. just get it.~ will"
0,Farenheit 451 was just an ok book. I was lost most of the time and the book didn't really make too much sense to me. If i had to read this book over again i definitely wouldn't.
0,"At first this item seemed like a bargain, but after following the directions of drying out after the first use, it never worked again. This product literally worked great for about 15 minutes. After that, I found out it was a little water logged so I sat it down to dry. It has not worked since. If you are thinking about buying this product because it is a good price then forget about it. It is a waste of time and money."
1,"Okay...So the run on sentences and the page long paragraphs get a little old and annoying...However, under all of this is a very intriguing mystery novel...Who actually killed Vinson Gowrie and how did Jake Montgomery end up in his grave?

However, one must be patient with Faulkner for he makes you work for every element of the story you get from his books...He's also one of those authors that you just have to keep reading...Re-reading pages isn't the best idea..."
0,"I rented this film because I'm a huge Morrissey fan. I knew nothing about it, but was excited to check it out nonetheless. I am usually not one to write scathing reviews, but I must agree with the reviewer who stated that this was one of the worst movies he or she had ever seen... Very rarely funny, My Life With Morrissey is a mixture of stupid ideas, redundant jokes, bad camera work and poor movie making. While watching the film (and I did force myself to watch the whole thing) I kept thinking, ""If this was a college film project and these were my friends, I would probably find it humorous... But I don't know these people, so it's just annoying."" It's not that I'm some humorless Morrissey fan upset about the portrayal of Moz and his fans, it is just that the movie is simply not good. If you REALLY want to experience this movie, by all means rent it -- don't spend your hard earned dollars on it..."
0,"I was really excited about the product after I read some reviews. When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual. I am still using the product even I know my skin is the same. No more velvet skin or nothing. I do have Keratosis, I bought this product believing in the reviews that I got from people with the same skin condition than mine. I used on my face also to try to take off some dark spot from sun, it didn't work yet.So I don't like this product because did not do anything for me. I feel I thrown money away."
0,"This book does not have any order, take a look at the chapter ""FILE I/O"", after reading that chapter the only program you can write and test is only a lame example of how to copy 2 files. After reading other books and references I found that explanation in this book about streams character-based and byte-based is totally confused and mixed, there is no explanation about high level or low level streams and everything is so confused if you have not done anything with Java. Other subject is Exceptions, how come 10 pages of text (with listing examples) is going to explain exceptions, just showing a chart of the class is not enough. I think this book does not help anybody who wants to learn Java or to someone who is doing some programming on java already , because there are better sources that this one."
1,Good value and love the products. Bought as a gift for my Dad's birthday. recommend to anyone with a car they love.
0,"What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie. Some of the actual score pieces are decent, but NONE of Elton's songs on this album are worth even a brief listen. Save your money and buy ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Madman Across the Water."""
1,"After reading SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, I would definetely recommend it to young adults and adults alike!"
1,"This is what I listen to when I'm in my Adult Contemporary mood. (Well it's Kershaw more often than it is Springsteen) I've heard of all Nik's old 80's albums, and this really makes them sound bad. I mean, of course, songs such as ""The Riddle"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" are better than anything on earth, but this new material is consistently impressive.""Billy"" is instantly likeable, while songs like ""Shine On"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are the slower favourites. ""God Bless"" is the only stinker, while every other song entertains us with cool guitars and songs that really grow on you over time.I guess all I'm trying, to say, it's worth the wait when an artist perfects their art instead of churning out rubbish twice a year."
1,It was just what I thought it was. I loved it. I watched a couple of time. I'll have to take it with me to my brothers so my nephews can see it.
1,"If you like WW II books this is the book for you. The book is about a girl named Patty that tries to save a German Soldier. One day her dad finds out there is a German named Anton in his house and forces him to leave. But then, something bad happens to Anton. The sheriff questions Patty and she finds out what happened to Anton.At first it was a boring, but now that I&#65533;ve read it I like it. My favorite character is Patty because she could relate to me a little because when Anton died she cried and when my great grandma died I cried. I gave this book four star because it is filled with happiness like when Patty found Anton again and sadness like when Ruth had to leave and it is a very good book. You should read it."

0,"I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."

0,I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.
0,Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville! This should be a demo for another singer to record.It's just too schmaltzy for me. I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too. Billy is a much better singer than this.After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match. I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses.
1,"This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!"

0,"The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to ""explode liberal myths"" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the ""successes"" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy."

1,"I received a TiVo box for Christmas and hooked it up in January. Instead of running wires all over the place I purchased the TiVo wireless USB adapter to connect the TiVo box to my existing wireless network. I simply actived the TiVo service online, then plugged the TiVo box to my home theatre, plugged in the TiVo wireless adapter, and followed the on-screen menu instructions. Everything worked perfectly, the first attempt. How many electronic / computer products do that, do you think? By the way, I am just an average computer user with few networking skills. I chose the TiVo brand adapter instead of others available to assure easy software compatibility."
1,"This is one of my favorite CDs that I've heard in the last year. If you don't end up loving it, you're at least guaranteed to think it's pretty funny.This is just one of those records you can't really intellectualize. You hear it, you love it or you hate it. It's all about fun fun fun and, for me, took no work at all to enjoy or ""get into"".For the late 90's, this was a very bold album to produce. So much pressure is put on electronic artists to sound absolutely new and completely groundbreaking, and this record isn't only tinged with 80's influences-- it often sounds like it was made IN the 80's.Most of these tracks are wonderful, I only find two to be unlistenable ""Soft Machine"" and ""From: Disco To: Disco"". The second to last, ""Sometimes"" is one of the most-played songs in my apartment.Get this CD!"
0,"Maybe I got a defective item in this shuffler. Bought it as a gift for my kids. I tried it out to make sure it worked before giving it to them and unfortunately, it is now back in the box it came in because only one side of the shuffler pulls the cards in. We really wanted them to have a shuffler so we went to Wal-mart and found one similar that works perfectly. The price was so inexpensive that we didn't bother sending it back to have to pay shipping. Again, it could have been one bad apple in the bunch. Somewhat of a disappointment."
1,"This is the season that started it all. Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season. The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper. The only problem? The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: ""The Ropers"" and ""Three's a Crowd."" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication. Watch this set and you'll see why."
1,"I gave this to my wife for Christmas and now we are both hooked on TIVO. Basically, just like everyone says it will, it changes the way you watch TV. Bye-bye commercials. See ya stuff we don't want to watch. Now we really do watch only what we want and we get to watch it on our schedule. Having said that, the reason I did not give it five stars is the setup is quite an undertaking. The hooking it up wasn't too bad, but the oodles of menus that follow take a while, and when we got to the part about linking it into our wireless network it went over our heads. We still have yet to get that feature to function. Even after you purchase separately the wireless network adapter, it seems as though the network itself must be set up in a pretty specific way. Luckily you can still do it through the phone line as well or we would be up a creek. Overall I would say that TIVO makes me happy."
0,Cheaply made and difficult for little hands to slide peek a boo parts. Wouldn't but it again. Not manufactured well-it looked old after just a few minutes of handling.
0,I bought these because I needed some diaper for when my daughter goes to great grandmas (or else my cloth diapers end up in the trash...) and they LEAKED EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Granted my daughter is a heavy wetter but these say 12 hours!!!! And they smell HORRID!!!! The poo went everywhere. I have NEVER had a leak in my cloth diapers. NEVER. 7 months so I was just used to packing her diapers and not spare clothes so I had to come home from work to get her. Last time I EVER use Pampers again. Everyone told me they were great. YEAH RIGHT!!! I wish I could give them a zero.
0,"""A Princess of Mars"" reads like a superhero comix. John Carter, a warrior on Earth, becomes a super-warrior on Mars because he weighs less there. He conquers aliens, wins the heart of a princess, and fathers an egg with her. As a fantasy for little boys, it's great. As literature for an adult woman, I'd give it a miss."
1,"Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times."
1,"Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."
1,"1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more."
1,"Just to add my voice to the rest here. It's hard to overstate the combination of message, artistry, and foresight in this book."
1,"It is a beautiful book. Horrific, unforgettable images and a lot of tragic emotions. I would not mind to see a bit less of the American point of view, less sentimentality and more universal view, but that's only my opinion. Overall, it's a keeper."
1,"Gov. Bradford's accounting is a must read - especially if you are concerned with the direction of our society.William Bradford's 1st hand accounting dispels the myths I've been taught regarding Thanksgiving, the Pigrims, their history, colony experiences, social structures, and relations with the ""savages."" Gov. Bradford clearly states that the communal, communistic social structure was a failure. Further, Gov. Bradford records what worked and saved the colony. Simply, the capitalist and free society of America is successful and to the benefit of all.Read for yourself, think and consider."
0,"This is the first time I ordered size 5. It was a defective pack. The sides stick to the inside of the diaper when I try to open up the diaper to put it on my child. When I forcibly pull them apart, plastic is left on the area my daughters bum will be, as well as strands of plastic left hanging that I have to be careful to pick off so my child doesn't get them. Hopefully it is just this pack. It still absorbs as Pampers usually do."
0,"Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary."

I also have The Thin Man series on DVD and this is every bit as good. I would have liked to see a few more extras, including commentaries or interviews, but the movies themselves are worth the price. It's a great chance to see lesser known but great films by great stars."

0,"Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."

1,"I am a Christian, and I found this book to be very helpful. It touches some personal areas that I wasn't aware of, and it has helped me enormously. I feel like I have a handle on my anger (with God help of course...)now. I recommend this to any Christian who needs it, and I'm sorry if this book offended those of you who aren't Christians. I think it has great basics covered, so even if you aren't a Christian I think it would help."
0,"This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
0,"I was disappointed in this movie. From the description, I thought it would be more comprehensive regarding Beau Brummell's rise to popularity in Regency England. It was more 'artistic'. I would not recommend."
1,"Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one."
0,"Well, I bought this album based upon the three songs I heard on the radio: Chop Suey!, Toxicity, and Aerials, and frankly I am dissapointed. This album is a hit and miss. On one hand it has some great songs on it, but on the other a few songs (namely Jet Pilot and X) bring it down. The only non-radio song on here that I have learned to like is Science and maybe Bounce (mainly for its comic value.)The band does have some talent, and they do have a unique sound to them. However, I think that if they trimmed off some of the lower quality songs on here, the album would have been better."
1,This CD collection is an incredibly good bargain. The quality is superb and the selections were excellent as well. I am happy I ordered this.
1,"""Batman Begins"" is a five-star film. Don't forget it. But the 2nd disc, packaged only with the ""Deluxe Edition,"" is one of the most underwhelming ""bonus"" discs ever sold. Yes, Christian Bale's transformation into Batman is amazing, but he merely talks about it--we don't see much of his grueling eating and workout habits. There's some insight into the director and screenwriter's collaboration, but to get there you'll need to page through a maddening ""comic book"" interface. By the time I finished making it through the ""interactive"" DVD, I felt like Bruce Wayne after his parents were murdered."
1,"A Love Supreme might be one of the most recognized jazz recordings. You have to read the liner notes as it describes what Coltrane was going through at the time and his devotion to God. This is Coltrane's attempt to honor and praise God. It is an album of devotion with Coltrane at his best. McCoy Tyner plays piano, Jimmy Garrison, bass and Elvin Jones on drums. Haunting, powerful music."
1,ALL I can really say about the movie is that the puppet steals the show. It really didn't matter how weak the story was because the puppet's comments made the show.
1,"When I first saw this movie had no idea that JCVD was going to be in it.I knew that Sho was.Sho always does great movies .Sometime they are alittle ""campy"" but the fight scenes are always good.JCVD really out classed Sho in this one.I give them both 10's anyway.The way that they interact make you think that they should make more together,but that was at the end of Sho's movie days and the beginning of Jean's.I think that anyone who wants to see a good movie will like this one.It's not just a martial arts movie."
1,"Clay Aiken is a hometown hero because he stands for something. He knows who he is and will not back down from his beliefs. I like how he is not using sex to sell his CD's. This is truly a CD for people who enjoy pop music, hey its for people who enjoy all kinds of music. I congratulate him on his first CD and hope it goes platinum."
0,"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
1,"Reading this made me understand why Benjamin Franklin is deemed a founding father of America in more depth than any history class could have ever taught. In using logic and reasoning, Benjamin Franklin reveals the beliefs and thought processes he used to grow into the symbol we all know him as today -the philosopher, inventor, genius. His story is inspiring as what he has to say about virtue and applying it to one's life to attain success. Atheist, Christian, republican,communist, young, old, whatever you are, this book will inspire you and show you what fulfilling the American Dream looks like done right."
0,"When I heard the Morning Glory I was expecting a great third album but....No!. This album shows no evolution in the music of Oasis and is like they want to sound the same in every song. The tracks are boring, the voice of Liam really makes you sleep, the guitar tones never change except in the acoustic tracks. The bass and the drums play a small role in this record. I hope Oasis think about it, and don't think about a ""Definetly Maybe Part 4"" for their next record."
1,"For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it."
0,"I watched as much as I could of this dreck, wondering why Jake Busey and Dominique Swain would waste their time working on such nonsense. Bad acting, poor effects, silly dialogue, and a totally improbable scenario here."
1,Essential original versions of some of the countlessly versioned riddims that made reggae great. A true masterpiece of Reggae.
0,"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
0,"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."
0,Gabrielle Anwar's uneven (and thus fake sounding) English accent fades in and out during this inane movie with a flimsy premise - four rowing buddies decide to share responsibility for the child carried by a woman they all lust for but promised never to pursue (and some don't remember sleeping with). This cheesy movie appears to be a really bad made-for-cable TV movie that miraculously has everyone getting their happy little ending.More miraculous is that it was made in the first place or that any of the actors are entertaining additional acting offers.
0,"Though good workmanship, I was expecting a heavier material for this brand name."
1,"I had James Rainwater (PJ) as my pastor for a year, and man, that was one of the best years I've had. He is a terrific guy, and a fabulous singer. Besides Free to Go, PJ also has The Gallery, Another Christmas (my personal favorite), and A Gospel Collection. They're all worth purchasing, and I highly recommend them all. If you get the chance to see one of PJ's concerts, GO GO GO!!! You won't be disappointed."
0,"Not for my taste. ""Stargate: Continuum"" has a very old plot that has been reused over and over again in both ""Stargate SG-1"" as well as in sci-fi stories in general. The first half is lacking in action, and you don't see much of O'Neill in this one. He shows up in the first few minutes of the film and the last few, but that's it. And the story is lacking in structure. The second half of the movie wasn't that bad, but still not worth wasting your money on.Not recommended!"
1,"This product fits perfectly on my wrists. It's light but at the same time it adds a little variety to your workout. If you are just a beginner like me, I highly recommend this product."
0,"Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that's foolish. This was our purchase this year. Thankfully we got a 50% credit for making the purchase (not sure what promotion it was since I didn't see it) and we got $1 toward Amazon MP3s. So our foolishness was credited, but before you buy this always remember that it airs on tv every year (in our case 3 days after we purchased it). If we had checked our TV guide we would have seen it and been able to record it for free. Buyer beware.Don't buy it."
1,"Well my previous review for this card was not good. But I just built a new, faster computer and put the Radeon to the test again. My new system is as follows: Tyan Trinity 510 MB(using the current via 4-in-1 drivers), Pent-4 1.8ghz(478 pin), Radeon 8500 of course, 256meg ddr pc2100 ram, WD 20 gig 7200 rpm hd, soundblaster pci 512 sound, antec full tower case w/300watt p/s, and the standard cd, ups, etc. My cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan, 3 80mm fans, and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon. After upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers I have a new found love for this card. Serious Sam SE plays like a dream and actually looks better than my GF4 MX card! Aliens vs. Predator 2-ditto. Word of advice, this card was designed for faster systems(1ghz and up) with the motherboards supporting 4x agp and fast writes. I think the new drivers ATI put out recently has helped also. Worth the money-now that is."
1,"I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. The dome is very solid to protect desserts but also fits nicely (and heavily) onto the base, keeping things fresh at room temperature. Highly recommended!"
0,"I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed."
0,"I bought this card to because it is a reasonably priced dual moniter card. I have two CRT's (21"" and 19"") and wanted to increase my desktop real estate. It does not work well for this purpose. Installation was easy in my Dell 8100 system, but there is only one vga plug on the card, the other is DVI. Great if you have a LCD, but otherwise you must use an expensive adapter... Anyway, the output from the DVI port is of very poor quality. This may be because of the adapter, but regardless. it does not have a useful second output. Too bad, now I'm trying to use two separate card, which will be much harder to configure."
0,"This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it, but there are always exceptions.If you're looking for a sweet Christmas tale, watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. If you're looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a ""moral"" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it. There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there, but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness."
1,Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.
0,"This is not a collection of shorts, as you would expect it to be. Rather, it's a disappointing collection of odds and ends. As others have noted in other reviews, there are only a few shorts. You're better off finding a different collection if you want to see the shorts, just as I will end up having to do. I think the case is very misleading as it says there is over 11 hours of material there and it doesn't specify what the material is."
1,"I started the book with having read the Old Man and the Boy first, so I was primed and ready for some good reading. I was not disappointed, Robert C. Ruark is a Masterful Wordsmith. I savored each word as a ""Right before You Go to Sleep"" read, the book was the High Point of the Day on a number of days, it always provided an exit into sleep after what lately have become stressful days. This should be required reading for anyone who hunts, it provides a distinct familiarity for anyone who has hunted. I felt that, I know that, I was Touched."
0,"I bought one of these adapters about a year ago to replace the original apple charger that came with my ibook G4. The Macally worked fine for about a year then died; since it lasted as long as the pricier apple one, I decided to go ahead and get another one. The new adapter - which is listed as exactly the same product I bought the first time - is physically different, and I think is not really compatible with the ibook G4; the charger doesn't always connect firmly to the laptop. And it could be a coincidence, but in the month since I have had it my computer has started having sudden power failures when running off a/c power (but has no problems running off battery). I guess I will be shelling out for the apple adapters in future - this one seems too risky."
1,"This is a fascinating book from a fascinating series with each chapter drawing you into the story, and each book into the world of Barsoom. The book flows with a wonderful lure of suspense, action, and romance. The whole series is a fabulous work of literary art. The victorian style science fiction coupled with the writing skills of Mr. Burroughs hooked me the moment I started reading. After twenty plus years, still the most favored of my collection."
0,this is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen! And definitly van Damme worst ever!The only reason I normally watch his films for is his fighting ability...but there's like no fighting in this one...and the rest of the action is nothing special....and this isn't even the worst part of the movie....the worst is the sotry it has to it......very pathetic altogether...skip this one!
0,"2 1/2Stagnant and stilted for the most part, the awkwardly translated prog-pop will appeal only to loyalists of the sub-genre."
1,"Only a few times in one's life does an album appear that is ""genius"". Oasis put there name on the map or Rock n'Roll gods with this realse dated from 1994. Every song on the album has top 10 single potential. Must listen tracks on this album are ""Live Forever"" ""Supersonic"" and ""Slide Away"". What's pleasing about this record is that it is raw and captures a band in a live like sound. Liam Gallagher's voice never sounded so pure and brother Noel's guitar elements make this a must have in anybody's record collection"
0,"This rack is a piece of junk. Within 1,000 miles, a part has fallen off, the pin bent, the frame sagged, and has rubbed my $2,000 mountain bike frame down to the aluminum. DO NOT BUY THIS RACK.For the initial journey, I put only three bikes on it for a long trip. The weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed. After my first leg, I pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly. So much so, I removed all bikes to ensure the rack was not failing. I found the pin bent only after 400 miles! As my trip went on, the rack continued to disintegrate. The rubber frame protector holding the frame to my bike fell off (don't ask me how as it was snuggly fitted to my oversized mountain bike frame). The metal to metal rubbing destroyed my paint and rubbed through my hydraulic brake line. My kids' bikes were also rubbed, dented, and scratched.Buy any other rack but this one. I personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes."
1,"I chose this book because I have read Ray's books before and enoyed them. The title seemed interesting, so I took it. His style of writing can be confusing, so you must concentrate while reading. I gave this book a ""thumbs up"" because it had an unexpected ending."
0,"HP should reimburse us all for this piece of junk. I have had it for over a year and selected after it researching and reading what reviews there were. Unfortunately, this is a QUALITY issue and there is no quality with his printer. Paper won't feed and it jams. All the previous reviews are right on target. The problem started almost immediately."
0,"I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product. If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!"
1,this is possibly troma's best film. ther plot concerns plane crash survivors battling terrorists on a beach. i would compare this to die hard and john woo's films.
0,It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.
0,"After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
1,I wish it had a shut of timer but other than that it works great. I'm going to buy another one.
1,This trainning pad is the most absorbant I've ever seen. It also attracts your pooch and can be soiled via urine a couple of times before being discarded. You never seem to smell urine and never have to worry about leakage however it is very costly. I have found pads that are much cheaper with slightly less of a quality. After paying high prices for this brand for over a year my eyes are begining to rove to the lesser costly brand.
0,I bought these daipers but they are not very absorbent. I got some from the hospital when We were discharged those daipers were awsome. I had the same problem with my first baby and I had t go find those pamper daipers from target. The price is very good on Amazon but I am not very pleased with the product. It doesnt absorb much and then the baby is wet and in winter changing clothes frequently for new born is not fun.
0,"I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more ""Basil of Baker Street"" from The Great Mouse Detective."

I AM REQUESTING A PHONE CALL FROM BOTH OR EITHER OF THEM SO THIS PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED, OR PLEASE COME PICK IT UP AT YOUR EXPENSE."
0,"Let's face it, Hot Space is filled with filler. But if you love Queen, and I indubitably do, you'll find several splendid touches. But you have to go mining for them...rather than having them explode into you, as great Queen so incomparably does. We must come out of denial and admit that this album is weak gruel, with more than a few good moments floating in it. But it is Queen, and even bad Queen has its pleasures."
0,"This whole book is ridiculous. Instead of wasting tons of space and loads of my time, I'll wrap it up quickly: What Douglass purports to be true in his book, i.e., the transfer of US POWs to the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia could not have happened. Look at the timeline. Douglass would have rational people believe that the Soviets would use the Czechs to transfer US POWs at the same time the Soviets INVADED Czechoslovakia. So, let's see - the evil KGB would enlist the help of the same people they were CRUSHING? Come on. This is ridiculous and shows that anyone can get a book published."

1,"This story is so true and one of my favorites. Meet Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny Nolan, who don't have much future in store for their intelligent and bookworm daughter. You learn about Francie, the so honestly true story. It's amazing that it isn't your story. The slums of Brooklyn come to life in this touching story. If you did not enjoy this book you have no passion for life, or no feelings for those who do exsist but you push them out of your mind."
1,"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""! Unlike that book, these stories are original (and not sad).My favorite story is ""The Hook"", because I enjoy scary stories about serial killers, and this one, like ""High Beams"", can happen, which makes it HORRIFYING!"
0,"Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!"

1,THIS MOVIE IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE SHOW BECAUSE IT'S LOTS LONGER THAN JUST 30 MINITES. BUT I SAW ABOUT 10 SPONGEBOBS ON NICK AT NITE LAST NIGHT BEFORE GOING TO SEE THIS MOVIE TODAY. I GOT OUT OF SCHOOL. SPONGEBOB IS MY HERO. I NAMED MY CAT GARY AFTER SPONGEBOB'S SNAIL. THE MUSIC IS ALSO GOOD. MY BROTHER GOT ME THE SOUND TRACK.

1,"I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller. There are many great examples of his works, without the commitment of an entire book. Henry really has a handle on what it means to be human."
0,I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.
1,"To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to ""get off the dead horse"" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."

1,"I bought this tripod for video tapping an upcomming family wedding and have tried it a couple of times to get used to it. I like the the smooth operation of the controls on the handle. The panning operation is likewise acceptable. The telescopic locking legs work well, but are light weight and can rock a little during panning. The lightness is also a plus because it collapses into a small over the shoulder bag for easy toteing. One hand on the tripod for stabilization and one on the control handle during panning works well."
1,"I bought this brush for my husband. He says this brush scrubs like perfectly for those times you want a hard scrubbing. He had tried many other brushes--all of which he said were too soft. It's too bad it's nowhere to be found now, I'd love to send one to my father."
1,"George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments."
0,"Looks great and very sturdy, unfortunately is not very easy to pry open. If you need to open it constantly during the day, not a smooth process."
1,"Yes, you can catch this program running in syndication frequently on many different channels, so why buy it? Well, I started thinking about a time in the future where it may cease to be aired and I feel this is a show that will continue to make me laugh way into my golden years :) . Yes, the situations they get into at times is over the top, but I know that I like watching television to ""escape"" my life and this is great entertainment. All of the actors do a great job, but John Ritter was a genius in his acting and comedic timing."

0,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old. When I first got the package, I noticed that the plastic covering was torn. This should have been my first clue. The product was NOT what the picture is. Infact, it's a cheaper one that costs 10$ less. I got the Mega 2 play land. I found it at Toys R US for 47$. The balls that were supposed to come with the play set were opened and had hair on them. The set is flimsy, attaches cheaply, and falls over very easily. Without the addition of the balls, I set it up and my 1 year old loved it. I determined that I was going to get a different brand all together because I was unhappy with the order. The balls, besides used already, were very cheap and squished easily. Overall this product sucks. I'm sending it back tomorrow ( i got it today). I will be ordering a different brand all together from Toys R Us. The tunnels don't even connect right...there are big holes where they attach. disappointed....."
0,"Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder."

1,"This album will not disappoint. I am not a big fan of Clay Aiken but I ended up enjoying the album; you will never hear more beautiful songs as softly sung by him. He sings in a voice that is smooth, mature- and he can really soar when he wants. This is a great ""feel good""album!"
1,"While most thrash/speed bands have watered-down their sound into something unrecognizable (Metallica) or begun to gravitate toward nu-metal (Slayer), there are a few that have retained their own identities, still playing the fast, brutal music that made them infamous to begin with. Sodom is one of those bands. The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal. Are they repeating themselves? Most likely, but I'd far rather listen to this material than any other ""metal"" being released by ""progressive, forward-thinking"" bands like Korn; turn up ""Addicted to Abstinence"" or ""Visual Buggery"" and forget nu-metal exists."
0,"Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. I found only the light construction part. While they seem durable enough, the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet. It's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons, but just not substantial enough for me."

Simply plug in the TiVo Wireless G USB Network Adaptor into one of the 2 USB ports on the TiVo and set up your network in the settings which you navigate through your TiVo menu. Very easy but very monopolistic."

Which is weird, because I don't have any other Amy Grant albums, and I'm actually not interested in any other albums by her. So you know there has to be something great about it. I heard this album, and promptly went out to buy it. I went on a cross-country train trip by myself last summer, and this CD was a great one to have while I looked out at America flying past my window and thought about life. I don't mean to sound dramatic or over-the-top, but this CD affects me in a way that VERY few other albums do. It trancends the normal music world."

I read all the reviews before purchasing and gathered that I might have to try different mugs but that was not the case. The only reason I give it two stars is because it happens to keep my hot beverage warmer a bit longer (3 mins maybe?) than it would if I didnt have the warmer but in the end it cools down just the same. I would not purchase again."
0,This was typical of what happens when a talented young artist gives up ! The songs are all fluff with no substance. He just talks about getting some (Wow what a new concept) This was pure cookie cutter Music. Shame on you Kelly
1,It was nice to here Enge's new cd and worth the wait. Anybody who has ever seen him perform will really think wow and close there eyes and think he is singing to me and only me. When he sings If Tomorrow Never Comes let that be a lesson on how short life really is and make sure you tell your loved ones what they mean to you.On his song Nothing a little love won't cure you can just see him up there moving that body to the song. Buy it and don't look back and say darn i should have gotten it.Enjoy i give it 1000 stars.

0,"My GF bought this amp as a present for me, and now she's very unhappy. We opened the shipping box, which was 5 times the size needed, removed the amp and hooked it up. We couldn't get it to do anything advertised! Nothing hooked up to it produced any sound. Only the green ""ON"" light and the red speaker lights worked. I called the 800 number for tech support at the mfgr. of this AudiolessSource Amp 100, and, after the normal recorded voice menu, when transferred, the phone just rang and rang. No support or customer service!! It went back today!!"
1,"After living in Singapore for seven years, I read a lot on the war in the pacific.This is one of my favorites. Though fictional, it captured what I saw and read about the Japanese occupation.Clavel is the one of the best."
0,"David Moody has written a hyper-realistic apocalyptic zombie survival thriller - not simply a knock off text of popular zombie movies, but a strongly character driven book.Three Characters who are so obtuse and dull, and written in the same first person voice as to be indistinguishable from either each other or the 3rd party intermittent narrator.Virtually nothing happens in this book - sure most of humanity is wiped out, and eventually rises in mass - but readers know how that goes; getting a hyper realistic look into the psyche of three nearly identical characters isn't that interesting - and certainly doesn't warrant 200 pages.Maybe as an American reader I expect more from both my zombie thriller and its protagonists, than several trips to the grocery store, lots of soup being consumed, and one brief chapter of massed zombies at the barricades."
0,"I recommend this product to no one because it was essentially plastic. It felt like it was throw together in and hour. The ""metal part"" bends too easy as it will break. If you want to truly cosplay, this is not the right headband. I tried bending it to make it look like my cosplay and it was terrible."
1,"This book was wonderful. My son needed it to improve his ASVAB score and it worked really well for us. He did score higher, a lot higher than his orginal score and we were both please with the results. I would recommend this to anyone attempting to take the ASVAB. You will reap the benefits if you read and study the book."
1,"I got my wife one of these 2-3 years ago but I always used my laptop on a desk until recently. If I had paid attention to her use of the Lapinator with Mousitizer, I would have gotten one a long time ago. The lap table has space for my 17"" laptop and a clip-on USB LED light. The Mousitizer is what makes this combo work so well. The table itself insulates from the heat, and the Mousitizer fits snuggly to the table. I think the optional rubber bumper border is a must to block your wireless mouse from falling off at the slightest tilt of the table. I tried another laptop table brand that folds for travel, but at home I don't use anything but the Lapinator."
1,"We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal."
0,This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market.
0,"This song stinks! Trust me. Try your luck with the import single, maybe those remixes are actually worth listening to."
1,My son and I had checked this book out from the public library and he loved it! He was so upset when we had to take it back so I decided to look online. We love Mexican food/culture and he thinks it's so funny after knowing the original song!I was so happy to have found it for his birthday!
0,"There was no reason to make another movie in this series, but I guess there were still some action figures to be sold so here it is. In PG-13, no less! Boy, where to start. Well after 5 or 6 years, the evil OCP is still trying to tame Detroit and build a bigger badder cop. Now the Japanese have taken over OCP and have a Robo of their own and they are twin/triplets? For the most part this 3rd feature is just as bad as the 2nd one, but at least we see some of the townsfolk putting up some resistance. I'm also giving a little credit for some then new acting faces that are more recognized today. Although Peter Weller wisely didn't come back in the role of Murphy watch for Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Mako, Stephen Root, Bradley Whitford and Jill Hennessy."
1,"I live in Broward County Florida and wasn't able to pull in the West Palm Beach radio station that Howard Stern is on now as I'm outside the stations standard range; not on my regular clock radio or even my stereo. However, the reception on this radio is so GREAT, the signal comes in nice and strong. If you want great reception and sound, get this radio."
1,"Back with avengances and rockin harder than ever. This CD is soooooo much better than the first one, w/o taking anything away from the first one which was great, this is definettly a great progression as a band, and they didnt loose their passion or anger like some bands of late... Tool, Staind, etc... you see the pattern. where all those bands try and be mellow and then rock like they used to cant pull it off like SOAD proved they can do AGAIN! Get this album if you're a SOAD fan you wont regret it at all.... THIS KICKS"
1,"I thought I had read everything by C.S.Lewis, and was pleasantly surprised when a friend recommended Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. I downloaded it to my Kindle while experiencing a rainy autumn week-end in Northern Michigan. Within this excellent read the sun came out, even though the rain was still giving me a great reason to curl up in a chair and enjoy the genius of Mr. Lewis. Needless to say, I spent a very enjoyable week-end because of this wonderful novel. I thoroughly recommend it!"
0,I'd rather shoot myself than lean from this book again.
0,"I bought this only because it had 5 stars w/ great reviews. What a disappointment once I received it and watched it. As the other reviewers have written: you do one sequence, then get a 1, 2 or 3 minute rest period. I never worked up a sweat. I didn't feel like I had done a workout, because I hadn't. The DVD that comes with Bob Harper's kettlebell you buy at Target is better. That one gives me a workout. If you want a workout with kettlebells, do not waste your money on this one. I should have sent it back and asked for a refund."
1,Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore make a great couple! the storyline promises greatness but it's even better! After the intial fun of such a subject (drew's character has no short term memory) they get to the meaningful part of the movie and just makes your heart fly it's so great! A must for everyone!!
0,"The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
0,"I figured for the price I'd give pampers dry a chance and now I'm incredibly disappointed with this product. I'm not exactly why it's called ""Pampers Dry"" since it does a horrible job at absorbing urine. On many occasions I'd have to change my baby's clothes simply because the urine has run up her back and wet her clothes along with my bedsheets.I'm going back to Swaddlers!"
0,"Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
0,"Who buys and listens to his stuff?! I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes? His voice sounds so average ""broadway musical"" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all."
1,"Even if some people disagree with me, I will say this is one of the best books you can read. Everyone must read this book, it has the power to change your beliefs about the world.1984 goes deep to show you what the world COULD be like if a ruling party did all the right things to gain complete control over the populace. Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading."
0,"This version of the film, from ROAN, should be avoided. The hour and 41 minute original is here chopped to an hour and 30 minutes. A mutilated film is no bargain at any price."

0,"I've tried ordering this title twice, and received the CD ""Canada Songs"" by the Daughters instead both times. I've since discovered that when you add it to your cart, it comes up as Naked Apes and Pond Life by Daughters (which still doesn't explain why I got the Canada Songs CD by Daughters). Arrgh. I've given up on ordering it until Amazon corrects it's database."
0,"The closest to valuable information this book has is: The % of emails you received compared to the number of times your profile is viewed. There is nothing else here that isn't already listed on most dating web sites themselves. Don't waste your money, just read the information provided by the site(s) that you are a member of.It also appears that this book was sponsored by two specific companies (3 sites) as their name appears all over this book, and the 100's of other sites are ignored.I was surprised to see that this book was only written by two people. It has the disjointed feel of being written by a large group of people. It jumps from talking down to people only looking for sex, to praising how easily you can get sex, to talking down to people whom consider religious compatibility important. And that's just one example. I truly thought that it was written by at least five different authors, and edited by people who didn't speak to each other."
0,These diapers are simply awful. I mistakenly ordered 192 of them! My poor son has woke up in the middle of the night absolutely soaked through. I will not purchase these again - sticking with the Cruisers from now on.
0,"Well, what can I say? This kind of writing would never make it past Mrs. Johnson, my 7th grade English and Grammar school teacher. I made many attempts at reading this gibberish. To those who like this book, kudos's to you few. I highly recommend this book as an anchor on night stands of insomniacs everywhere. I join the ranks of those who do not like this book. I'm sure there is something enriching in there, somewhere. Who was the editor? I know it was not Mrs. Johnson!Jimmy Lair"
0,"This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best."
1,"Never has a book made me think so much and yet be absolutely terrified for the future. Ending is very bleak and gives one the impression that all hope is lost, but I still highly recommend it."
0,"I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
1,"I enjoyed the book, however, at times, I thought it was slow and very predictable. Sometimes it felt as if the author was dragging the storyline out to add length to the book. On the other hand, it was an easy enjoyable read."
1,"I loved this story and am sad to have just finished the last page. Maggie Osborne is a brilliant storyteller. Her heroines are unforgettable, strong, funny, and completely real. She paints such vivid portraits with her novels. Lady Reluctant has risen to the top of my favorites by Ms. Osborne. It's everything one wants a romance novel to be and more....I rarely laugh out loud while reading and this book did it to me! Get this book and enjoy...it's a great adventure that will have you longing for more."

1,"I was amost completely happy with this soundtrack. What upsets me is that there was on particular track from the game that I loved, and it was because of this track that i payed for this c.d.

1,"This movie could have easily been an inane, repititious, piece of garbage. Just cast one, or more, of US Weekly/STAR/TMZ's latest darlings. Let 'em stumble through the film with mediocre acting skills- but perfect hair and make up! The pay off? Why those opening weekend box office returns of course!Instead, ""The Descent"" takes the road less traveled, no pun intended. The cast are relative unknowns (at least to me, sorry if any of these women are household names in another country, shame on my ignorant behind) and they are all exceptional. These characters balance gritty and vulnerable so well. Altruistic and nurturing one minute, egomaniacal and totally aloof the next.The film exploits a common phobia; being trapped, enclosed places, etc., by showing us the most extreme and terrifying scenario. And it works! This movie is chillingly intense."
0,"This book talks of slavery in a positive light. Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."
0,"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an ""and"" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."
0,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this! When I got the product, I had before-hand read some reviews about it falling apart or something. So, before I wasted the sand that came with it and caused a mess, I gently pressed on the wood/base part. It was flimsy, but I didn't think much of it. Then, while just doing a quick look over, I noticed that there was a small disconect between the bottom base and the black lining. This would cause the sand to leak out of the crack! Then, the base fell write off! I noticed that it had very tiny, small metal pieces that had wood from the base around it. I now realize that they probably put the metal into it, painted the top black, then pushed on the base to connect the two parts. The little ""stubs"" that hold it up have superglue stains from where they glued it to the bottom of the base. How cheap! I really don't know what to do now. I'll probably get my dad to put some nails in it. Really, the Dollar Tree would probably make a better structure!"
0,"Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. This game is proof.The graphics are beautiful, which accounts for the extra star for the overall rating. If you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will absolutely hate this game, as I do. The controls, the plot, and the movements are maddening, boring and confusing, respectively. Eidos could plug Tomb Raider 1 into this engine and have a much more interesting game.Maxim magazine gave this game 5 stars. A good reason to ignore Maxim's ratings."
1,This book was fascinating. It took a short passage from the bible and painted a picture of how it could have been. I will definitely be reading more of these books.
1,"Both my grandson and grandaughter have gotten many years of use out of this wonderful kitchen island. Very well made, sturdy and looks great, It actually stays in our kitchen so they can cook when we cook. I absoluately love this product. If you are lucky enough to find one it will be well worth the money. A family heirloom."
1,"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."
0,I was disappointed to find this was a children's version of the Jules Verne novel. Amazon's description of it doesn't make this clear.
0,"I just tried listening to the cd again and still could not find myself liking anything in it. they all soumd alike and boring, the arrangements are so horrible and mediocre and for anyone used to good music this just doesn't make sense.In fairness to Clay who has an awesome and powerful voice, you do not deserve this crap of songs and i hope that he would look into these seriously. please realize that the fans are a varied bunch from the teenyboppers to the older ones with very discriminating tastes. i happen to be one of them, and though i loved all of the AI2 performances i was really expecting something that would be appealing and enjoyable. sadly i find nothing here that makes me want to listen to it again and again.I hope the second cd will be of better quality w/ good vocal and musical arrangement, better songs that would showcase Clay's singing talent."
1,"I love to use this book as a quick visual reference while working on shows. When helping a customer, or explaining something to an assistant at our shop, this book is the easiest way to do so. It is so great to have a book where I can flip to a certain date, and have pages full of pictures grouped together to show someone what exactly I am thinking of. We have to work at a fast pace, and this book saves me lots of valuable time."
0,"My sister gave us a package of Pampers baby-dry diapers so we decided to try one on a recent diaper change. These diapers are awful! The sticky (not velcro) tabs don't stretch and the diaper doesn't fit as well as Swaddlers and bunch up between the legs. Are these made from recycled paper? Pampers Baby-Dry & LUVS are basically the same diaper since they are both made by Proctor & Gamble and are both bargin brands. Stick with Swaddlers, Cruisers, or Huggies."
0,"i have always been a fan of romantic comedies, and i've even been able to enjoy formulaic ones such as the wedding planner and it could happen to you, but this movie is just too awful. the acting is atrocious and cher is just way too old for the part (is she supposed to look fifty?). personally i love nicholas cage but there is nothing appealing about his character in this movie and the thick black hair all over his body certainly doesn't help.none of this would have annoyed me greatly had the lines in this movie not been so hokey and badly delivered. i think i laughed, at most, twice, which is sad since i am easily amused if the lines are halfway witty. if you rent this movie you probably won't die from sheer mortification that such a bad movie could be made, but Moonstruck is certainly not a good enough movie to buy!"

1,"While reading the book I found myself traveling along every page, visiting the Greek islands and walking alongside Ulysses in his long journey. In this journey, I explored the different sides of Greeks and how even today their strong sense of self emerges in their daily lives. The book creates a bridge between the past and the present revealing that Ulysses journey to come back home represents our own desire to attain fulfillment."
1,"Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping."
1,This is the best hockey game ever. You'll never want to stop. There is every team and player. Theres a mode were 2 people can play each other and you can just play the com. just for fun. There is also a franchise mode where you go threw as many seasons as you want. You can also trade players and sign free agents. Theres also a draft after each season. You can also set the difficilly level to any thing you want. Theres also a season mode where you can just go through only 1 season. Also theres a playoffs mode were you skip the season and go right to the playoffs. It has the best grafics too. The bad thing is that you can't create your own team like in NFL 2K3. I recremend this game to everyone...

The examples are great - nice and simple to start out with - and the Struts Framework is covered clearly and in detail. I've ordered my own copy, and I showed the book to a co-worker who then bought one too. All in all a great book."

1,"We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."
0,"My suburban hot water heater drains where the Anode rod is. It is 1 1/16 and the wrench description does not indicate it is for, I believe, a Pet Cock fitting. Camco should better describe this item showing the size fitting it is designed for. Camco should know better."

Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up"
1,I have been looking for this movie for some time. I finally found it and thuroughly enjoyed it again. Its somewhat over the top fantasy kung fu is great fun to watch with great cheesy chi effects and magic kung fu styles. Its definitel not for everyone tho if you enjoy cheesey kung fu films you will probabaly love this one as much as I do
0,really slow service..... took me almost 3 weeks. And the cover is different the one displayed so are the page numbers.
0,"I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."

1,"""Be Here Now"" is for sure the best Oasis album. It has their greatest songs, and it shows how well they can make music.When I bought this CD I wasn't sure if I was going to like, but after I listened to songs like ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", ""All Around The World"", ""Stand By Me"", and the title track ""Be Here Now"", I saw that once again Oasis did a great job!!"
1,"This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an ""assembly required"" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included, so don't buy an extra chair separately!"
1,"This is not one of those great five star Boetticher films (Comanche Station etc.), but still a very good one (4,5!). Scott is always good. He is so natural that one does not give enough credit for his acting. There are a lot good actors in this film though my favorite Virginia Mayo does not have very much to do. The only minus is the somewhat predictable story. Burt Kennedy did not write this one. I recommend this film highly. The dvd quality is also great."
1,"I purchased this rice cooker during a promoting Amazon had, which saved me $50, and it was the brand that I wanted. It's very easy to use; either use the green cup (for pre-sifted rice) or the clear cup (for regular rice), add water, and press the start button.This rice cooker live up to all its claims, and delivers the goods. If you have no special need in timers, cooking porridge or brown rice, then this rice cooker is overkill (big time) and you can purchase a less expensive model (such as the Zojirushi NS-MYC10 (5 cup model), or the NS-MYC18 model (10 cup)).The only annoyance (very minor), was each time you started to cook, this rice cooker has to make a sound (either a beep, or twinkle-twinkle little star). I haven't found a way to make it silent when it starts or ends cooking (without beeping or playing a melody). A minor annoyance, but other than that this is a very good rice cooker."
1,"Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing."

0,"I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars."

1,"I had never considered reading a vampire novel until I stumbled across ""Blood Games"" while searching for novels on ancient Rome. St. Germain's dangerous yet compellingly compassionate character completely drew me into the story and I've since been reading my way through the rest of his history. Ancient Rome's excesses and casual disregard for human life is sharply contrasted with the vampire's compassion and loyalty to the people around him. His essential ""humanity"" is shown most in his relationship to Olivia, the horrifically abused wife of the villian, who becomes one of the enduring loves of his life. If you've never before considered reading a vampire novel you'll change your mind once you've met St. Germain."
1,"I read the reviews before buying this product and one review said it made loud nose as dial turns.. and s/he is completly right. The noise it makes is pretty loud.. I would NOT recommend this for the bedroom if you are going to use it as some type of sleep timer b/c the noise will bother you. However, I have this installed on my storage room in the kitchen, so the noise is not an issue."
0,"Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short."
1,"Most of this is on the collections ""My Best"" and ""Essential,"" but one killer cut is not: Got to Move. If you like Sonny Boy solos that start slow and then slay you with one intense phrase, ""Got to Move"" delivers."
0,"I can see this is an unpopular but not unique opinion, but this is one of the very few books I've stopped reading halfway through. And I have no intention of ever finishing it. Despite the fact that I horde books, I gave this one away.While the prose was beautiful, the story tended toward the dull and was difficult to follow. The fact that there were only a handful of names reused by dozens of characters did not help much. Most of the characters were unlikable and hard to relate to. After awhile I decided I just didn't care anymore.Is this book a masterpiece? Perhaps it is, but that doesn't mean it's a good read."
1,"Childhood memories are some of the strongest sensory feelings anyone will ever have. When we were kids we knew how we felt, we just couldn't always determine why we felt that way and couldn't possibly put our complicated feelings into words.In ""Jim the Boy"" Tony Earley takes universal childhood emotions of pride, jealousy, greed and companionship and strikes up a story to rummage through his own memory of childhood complexes. It's been done before--""The Wonder Years"" TV show comes to mind--but Earley doesn't play for laughs here. Rather he takes a grown-up's understanding and experience of the world and latches it onto the illuminating eye of a child.Earley succeeds in creating a quick, nimble book that, even though it's set in 1924, could have happened yesterday."
1,"This is one of the best Superhero films ever because is both entertainingbut at the same time, displays a kind of emotional intensity that I'venever seen before in the Batman Series.. it's extremely well producedbut the MVP goes to Christian Bale (who finally gets to really touch 'em all as Batman).He's one of the finest actors of my generation!!"
0,this is the worst band i have everheard in my life. I would rather listen to debbie gibson all day long.their politics are lame and their chord changes are boring and uncreative.more like the worst cd of 2001.
0,Publisher: I will NOT buy a book that has been on the market since the middle of the last century in paperless format for these kind of prices. You've got to get your head back out in the open where you can see.Amazon: Get busy leaning on the publishers to bring their prices down. Why is an ebook as much as a hardback???This has got to stop. I think I'll pitch my kindle in the trash.Disgusted in San Diego
0,"Rev. Teel starts out by telling how he was first a believer, then an agnostic, then an atheist, and finally a true believer, but neglects to say what convinced him in each of those instances. If belief, not reason (as it appears), were behind these conversions, then the premise for this book is reduced in importance and effectiveness. For me, one belief is as good as another. I'd like to hear from a writer convinced by reason and recognized facts, not belief(s)."
0,"Audio is technically flawed. The instumental sounds are Not crisp and clear. The musical selections and the Ellington orchestration are excellent. But the unclear Audio makes listening to this album like viewing a blurred, out of focus photograph. Definitely NOT a worthwhile selection for serious Duke Ellington afficionados."
1,"Good movie, especially if you enjoy the old Universal horror movies. Knew little about ""Frankenstein"" director James Whale, but movie gives much insight."
0,These batteries last approx 1 hr which is the same recording time from the originals plus these are considerably larger
0,"I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good."
1,This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again.
0,"This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge."
0,"I was quite unhappy to know that this wasn't a ""Collection"" of shows, but more of a ""The making of"" series. There were only a few episodes on it, and the rest of it was a disappointment by a long shot! If you are looking for watching actual Three Stooges, DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,"I had a huge wart at the bottom of my big toe a few months ago. I used a brand that says PAINLESSLY REMOVES ... apparently it was painless for the wart, bec. it was so painful for me when the wart swelled to 3x its size and some form of liquid inside. A few more days of pain then the swelling started to subside and wart came off... BUT WAIT... its not done... after a couple of months, I noticed more warts growing... like 7~9 more smaller ones at about the same area.I ordered this last week, didnt start using till 2 days ago... and I was surprised after 1 application, the smaller ones just peeled off in the shower and the bigger ones are not looking as tough and seems about to fall off in another couple of application.Now any suggestions how I can keep them off me?PediFix Wart STICK"
0,"Pleasant reading material, but not in the same league as some of the other Julie Garwood books I have read. A good tale, but not much excitement."
0,Not happy with this product lots problems!!!Not work at all for me. Had a person who is computer nam look at it and everything. He not get it either.
1,"Upon hearing ""How it feels..."", I was blown away by the overpowering musicianship, as well as the different ranges Jeremy sings in. Although it lacks the driving breakdowns and pure ""rock"" moments of the past, it most definetly is an album that changes for the better. I feel this is a more mature album, by a matured band. Every song has its own special appeal, that keeps you listening (like I would have turned it off anyway). It's also a great album to listen to after smokin' a few jizoints, or before bed!"
0,"I am by no means a prude but I find no interest in women or men ""whipping"" someone for reasons I can't fathom. To dicipline, arouse ,or to train them; it escapes me. Too 'kinky' for my taste. In all fairness, I never made it past the first few chapters either in this book or the first of Sleepy Beauty's triology. The theme was obvious. I will assume there is a message in these books but I didn't care to find it. I gave this 1 star because it was required to submit the review. Rereading this, this review DOES make me SOUND like a prude! In synopsis, if you like whips and chains and that sort of thing, you like the book; if not don't waste your money. I don't even want to donate them to our local library."
1,the product is cute and just what i was looking for. they were very helpful when i called and asked a question prior to making my puchase.
1,this c.d. is off the hook. it blew the sets up down here. everybody need to quit hatin cuz you don't know what's up hot boys can flow and they be tearin up the charts
0,"This book had me convinced that amy twins would have some type of birth defect, or that something would go wrong with my pregnancy, labor, or delivery. I read this when I was on bedrest, and finally had to remove it from my room because it scared me too much. The author seemed only to concentrate on what could go wrong with a twin pregnancy. I would recommend the only other twin book I read - ""Keys to Parenting Twins."" It's much more positive! By the way, my twins were born completely healthy & normal at 36 weeks."
1,Love it but not as good as the other 2. Shia is great as always and love the soundtrack also but that is just me. Very good graphics but I was really paying more attention to the story and ya gotta just love it when dictator obama is spliced into a movie as the good leader that he isn't and they made George W. Bush look like an idiot. But this is hollywood and they suck.
1,This book should be required reading in all schools. Not onlyas a tribtute to his remarkable efforts but to further the moral and social education of all races.
0,"I do.Now it is dictated, in part, by a whiny, COMPLETELY sub-par, snot nosed walking bag of talentless junk who only has a record because a bunch of people on Fox's lowest common denominator TV show.And the album is really bad, at that. It'll be really popular at dentists offices. Please, PLEASE, use your hard earned money to support real artists. I BEG of you. This is pop culture at it's most vapid. The tool didn't even win. Just because he can sing doesn't mean he has a personality, or creativity."
1,"I am a big fan of the two young gun movies. The chemistry between all the actors make it a memorable film. Emilio's portrayal of ""The Kid"" will stay in my memory forever. At the end of the movie you are left with the memory of the laugh he always does."
1,This was an absolutely awesome deal on great diapers! Pampers diapers have always been my favorite and I am thrilled that I don't have to carry the boxes while grocery shopping with 4 kids.

1,My daughter is 3 and she loves all of the Barbie items but they are still sometimes too big and hard for her to play with. I finally convinced her to try out Barbie's sister Kelly with this Jumpin Castle playset and she loves it. The playset was not hard to put together - it only took me about 5 minutes. The only thing that did not impress me with the toy is the cardboard cutouts in the box that you fold up to be presents for Kelly. We just tossed those but the toy itself is great and is teaching my daughter how to pretend play.
0,"Well written, but boring and containing bad conclusions. The whole story hinges on a laid-up detective thinking a painting of someone's face makes him look innocent of murder. What!? Come on! Give me Agatha Christie."
1,"I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
1,"Breathless - in it's lean, pared down, gritty realism - is a seminal movie. Michel Poiccard (Jean Paul Belmondo) is a disaffected youth, a sort of French James Dean, who steals a car, shoots a policeman, then goes on the run. Whilst trying to track down money he is owed so he can escape to Italy, he pursues his affair with the beautiful, bird like Patricia by breaking into her hotel room. In a memorable, drawn out scene, the two lovers flirt and fight amongst the pillows, discussing the deeply philosophical and the trite and trivial. The dialogue sequence in this scene is a superb piece of cinematic realism. The detail of Breathless - Michel's white shirt and Bogart style cigarette and hat combo, Patricia's striped dresses, he city of Paris, a sharp jazz score, the doomed forebodings of noir - raise this film up to its position as Flicks magazine puts it: the yardstick of celluloid cool."
0,"OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
1,"What helped me understand this monument of literature a bit better was the anecdote I read in Nora Joyce's biography ""Nora"", where she complained that she couldn't sleep at nights when Joyce was writing FW in his working room, laughing at his own scribings.Finnegans Wake is one of the most hilarious/beautiful books I've read. In fact I could replace the ""hilarious/beautiful"" with just about any other adjective, and it would explain as much."
0,"I do think the author has a valid message. Too many runners run without enough attention to their form. Unfortunately the book is overflowing with self-reported testimonials litered throughout. The constant repetition of what the author perceives to be core messages will insult your intelligence. It caused me great pain to try to avoid skipping entire pages for fear of missing an important message. The author is trying to sell way too hard, which makes for an unpleasurable reading experience. It left me with an aftertaste of having read an infomercial for a DVD, website and training courses. My recommendation to the autor: read Steven King's ""On writing"". The current form of writing must be be limiting the success of this book -preventing it from realizing its true potential. I cannot recommend it."
0,"I bought the Donna-Mite tape based on the previous reviews and was very disappointed. While I loved Donna's personality and enthusiasm and really like the music, I found the tape VERY ""dancey"". Perhaps I'm a major klutz, but I just couldn't follow the steps. Every time I caught on, they'd move on to another step."
0,"So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
0,"When compared to some of the other wonderful literature that is available for children, this book doesn't have a leg to stand on. It was poorly written and rather boring. (...)"
1,Just what I needed. Worked like a charm. Loved the various sizes. I suggest using an x-acto cutting mat underneath the leather. It'll get destroyed but it gives you a nice clean cut.
0,"We started out with Swaddlers, then moved to Baby Dry at size 2. At size 3, we switched to Huggies. No Pampers diapers have elastic on the back waist, which just asks for a poo explosion up the back. We had SEVERAL, and I finally realized my friend's diapers had elastic in the back so she didn't have this problem! She had a generic store brand even! I will never put a Pamper on my kid again because I don't want his clothes stained."
1,"The description of the stream in the opening scene is alone worth the price of the book. And then comes the dialogue, of which Steinbeck was a master. Holds up well!!"
0,All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set
1,Dylan? Jagger and Richards? Lennon and McCarthy? For my money the best songwriter ever is Guy Clark. His latest effort does not dissapoint. It is a social injustice that Guy Clark isn't a megastar. Nashville needs to wake up and recognize the talent that they have and not the hacks they continue to play on the radio. The Shawn Camp song is awesome. Shawn Camp is the best kept secret in the world. Here's hoping he does another album someday.

1,"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
1,"I thought their last effort was kinda soft and lacked enought thought to be a good CD. So I was hoping this one would do the trick. GREAT CD!! They sort of stray from the Heavy guitar sound that carried them in earlier efforts and go for a Dream Theatre keyboard/sound with heavy guitar. I personally think the keyboard addition gives the sound a little more melody and adds some spice. As for the previous reviewers comments on no melody within the choruses or songs, I didn't find it to be true. This is a solid CD with some minor changes that any power/melodic METAL fan will love!! I found it to be a back to the basics CD. everything is simple and to the point! Sometimes you just need a catchy riff some solid drums and a good tune. This CD delivers that. Nothing elaborate, just straight ahead METAL!!!!! ROCKON!!"
0,"I was quite disappointed with this collection. After the first three stories, I basically gave up. Interesting concepts that could have benefited a great deal from a really good editor. This stuff really belongs in 12th grade creative writing class."
1,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
1,"I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!"
1,What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
1,This is an amazing deck of cards. They are very easy to use with some practice and you can fool anyone into thinking you are a true magician. This is a great buy for anyone who likes card tricks. It is lots of fun.
1,"DEVIN IS A GREAT RAPPER BUT WHO IS VERY UNDERRATED. I HAVE ALL OF HIS C.D. EVEN THOUGH HE DOSENT GET ALLOT A PLAY DOWN HERE IN JACKSONVILLE FLA. WAITIN TO EXHALE IS A GREAT AND FUNNY C.D. I WOULD RECOMMENED IT TO ANY ONE WHO LOVES DEVIN OR IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NEW OR WHO JUST WANTS TO KNOW WHO THE DUDE IT. EVEN THOUGH IN MAGAZINES IT SAYS THIS IS DEVINS BEST CD YET I THINK THAT THE OTHER 3 WERE BETTER. TO THE XTREMM , JUST TRYIN TO LIV AND THE DUDE ARE OFF THE CHAIN. I WOULD JUST RECOMMENED EVERYBODY TO GET THE DEVIN THE DUDE C.D. HE MAKES U LAUGH, AND ALSO IT GREAT MUSIC TO SMOKE TO!"
1,"Good movie with good story line. Just what I expected from this, good story line with live issues. Not a typical Hollywood movie."
1,"This movie is one part of the ""Cavalry Trilogy"" directed by John Ford. Ya gotta collect all three to get the best of the west from the U.S. Army's perspective. Hey, it's got John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Ward Bond, Shirley Temple (all grown up), and introduces handsome John Agar (Shirley Temple's future real-life husband). It's a great movie. If you have not seen it, you'll love it. If you have seen it before, you know what I mean."
0,This looked like it would be lots of fun but it's very hard and uncomfortable and doesnt vibrate very well at all. Dont waste your money
0,"While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
1,"All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
1,"I haven't actually read Cienfuegos - yet. However, I purchased Caribes via the internet purely because I had been recommended the author and did not realize until I received it that it was the second of a series. Today I was looking for the third in the series - Azabache as I simply have to find out what happens to Cienfuegos next! Caribes is the first spanish book I have read cover to cover and I can't wait to get hold of the next . Great characterization. Vasquez - Figueroa certainly has a vivid imagination which constantly surprises you while instilling a sense of history about the conquest of the New World. Please, please please can Amazon get in ALL of the books in this series as well as Tuareg and Yaiza which I have also been highly recommended (untranslated)"
0,"This Inner Life lp is much like the earlier ""I'm Caught Up"" in that it showcases a spectacular song (""Moment Of My Life"") and the rest is filler. This track can be found elsewhere on compilation sets in both original and remixed forms."
1,"Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."

1,"I read Sweet Dream Baby a few weeks ago, during a period of much stress & strife, and I loved it because I could get totally lost in it and in Travis' wonderful voice (also the great use of popular songs). I quickly ordered Sterling Watson's earlier book from Amazon, but was sorry to find no sequel that would allow me to see if and how Travis and the rest of his seemingly normal (at first), bizarre, sad family navigate the rest of their lives. Fun to read, beautifully written, thought-provoking, disturbing."
0,"Immortal and emperor are the only ones that should be here. Where is darkthrone? What about uh Mayhem?? Satyricon? Dimmu Borgir, please. They haven't done anything new. Other then the Immortal and emperor this is a bad list. I mean, Arcturus is good, but they have what one or two true black metal albums. Bring out the classics."
0,"When I heard their first album, leitmotif, I was blown away (something that only ocassionally happens). A fascinating album, combining various instrumentals with well placed vocals. so some time went by and eventually I bought the follow up, el ceilo (sp), and to say the least it was really damn disappointing. songs were too structured, ambiant sounds were predictable and not-interesting. and the lyrics SUCKED. i was really bummed. but then I saw a new album comming out. alright, perhaps they learned from mistakes, perhaps every song won't sound over-produced and catchy. instead, it only got worse. if you had never heard this band before, ""catch without arms"" will probably sound alright. but if you knew how good they were on leifmotif, don't buy this. i feel like i wasted my money (and i rarely feel that way about music). dredg has lost whatever it was they had. they are just mediocre. a real tragedy"
1,"When I bought this anime, I thought that is would be good but not excellent. After I finished watching it, I realized that this was one of the better animes that I have watched in a while. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was only like an hour long and it would have been a lot better if they spread this anme out into 2 hours instead. I hope that they come out wth a sequel!"
0,I enjoyed the 1st Transformers movie for what it was. Found the 2nd to be unwatchable. This one is better than the second one but what is that saying.
1,This book is the second-best book on TOEFL after Educational Testing Services' (ETS) TOEFL book.
1,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It was fast pace and very entertaining. I really enjoy the ""ending."" The lead character Lola is awesome she is tough and also very feminine at the same time. I would highly recommend this film."
1,"Peter Urban was a pioneer in American karate and helped not only spread the art of goju ryu, but the ripple effect helped the promotion of other martial arts as well in the 60s and 70s. While a little eccentric, Urban was true to the bushido roots, while adapting karate for an American population.This book covers karate philosophy in its mid-twentieth century form and promotes the positive aspects of discipline and etiquette. The book deals with attitude and motivation of spirit. The second half of the book has ""dojo stories"" that help embody the essences of karate training.This is just a nice and simple book worth the read."
1,My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.
1,"This product is a good value, and Pampers Baby Dry work best for my son. They don't leak, despite the fact he is a super wetter, and I love the Caterpillar Flex sides. Cute Sesame Street designs as well."
0,"The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end."
1,I bought Mosby's because it's easy to read and look up medical terms. I'm learning the language and this book is formatted for easy readability. The numerous illustrations are all in color which I found informative. It's definitely a user-friendly dictionary.

1,"Works fine, seems to be as well made as you are going to get in a cheap consumer electronics accessory. Ordered on Friday, arrived on Monday - can't beat that for service."
1,"This is my second endeavor into the famed distopia trilogy. Unfortunately, I should have read this one first. I loved Brave New World, but I think this is in a class by itself. I read somewhere that Brave New World was written without knowledge of this book, which would make the similarities uncanny. Anyway, This story grabbed me from the very beginning with the effective use of numbers to substitute characters names. This let's you know right off the bat that this future society is not joking around. The intertwining fashion used between dreams and reality was especially appealing, giving this novel a surrealistic feel. The thing that hooks this novel into masterpiece status is the ending. Unlike Brave New World, this was one I was not expecting. Also, the fact that a man living in communist Russia wrote this novel really enhances the experience and shows you the nightmarish visions this man derived from his way of life. Platinum."
0,"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
1,"After becoming addictive to the CSI series, I just can't seemto get enough. So I purchased the third complete series to geton with the excitement and I couldn't stop.Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotionsand perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And WarrickBrown returns to his oldneighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.All in all, if you're into CSI: Las Vegas, you'll enjoy thisseason as mush as 1 and 2."
1,"I like this product. It's low profile and a great value. I connected a radio and cd player to it. The radio should kick out automatically once the CD player starts. My only minor complaint is the radio doesn't kick out until the sound output from the CD is high enough. I once played a CD that has a very quiet passage at the beginning, it didn't switch over until it got louder. If you are just looking for a great amp that you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend, this is the amp for you. The auto power feature on is great. The sound is very clean and faithful. I do wish it had a subwoofer out. That would make it perfect for me."
0,Bought this for my wife to replace an old cup warmer she had that died. She was totally disappointed with the product. It was not effective at keeping coffee in her mug warm.
0,"This book is boring,terribly written and dryer than a year old cracker. Saying that J.K Rowling plagurised this is a sheer insult to a great writer. My advice to the writer is take a little more time to actually write a good book instead of tring to sue other people! Seriously, I felt like a genuis trying to read Barney's play time! Take my advice and save some innocent tree in a forest somewhere, and don't buy this book! If you want to read this ridiculous excuse for a book visit a library!"
1,"one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense."
1,"You'd think for such a high-end, costly ""entry-level"" laptop, buying a replacement part would be affodable. This isn't the case with the apple ibooks. The cords which seem prone to damage and breaking down, are $80.00 to replace if you go to Apple. That's a lot of money for a cord that will in all probability break in around 8 months.The Macally is a great alternative - it's a lot cheaper and has been very, very durable. The one drawback is that it doesn't light up the side of your laptop (red when charging, green when charged). Other that than, it's great! Good purchase for me."
0,"The material on this CD is terrible, and Clay's uninspired singing just makes the whole endeavor worse. The songs here are as generic and bland as you can imagine, and they contain some of the worst lyrics in pop music history. ""If I were invisible, I would be the smartest man?"" Poor production values don't help. Even the most enthusiastic pop devotee is going to have a hard time respecting this slapped-together piece of commercialism.Clay Aiken also doesn't do himself any favors with his bland and routine delivery. Clay has a powerful voice, and if he had a little more imagination and a little more artistry, he might have elevated some of this material. Instead, he seems to be relaxing on cruise control as he resorts to predictable phrasing and timing with frustrating regularity. No soul, no subtlety, no artistry.Start to finish, this is an obvious rush effort on the parts of the producers, the songwriters, and Clay himself. At least I hope so."
0,This book was totally boring. Even though it was 1 of the greatest books I've read.HAhahahaha

King indeed; he's pretty good but the King has been dead awhile (notwithstanding the occasional phantom sighting) and the remaining living creators of original rock and roll - Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry are very much alive and touring and in Jerry Lee's case still recording great music.I'll take a look at buying this if I can see and hear what it is!Jimp.s. sorry for the 1 star but ..."
1,"I was a bit put off in the beginning with the poor quality of the DVD, the picture seemed to be grainy. The theater was very dark and you saw very little of the orchestra or the conductor. But when the singers 'warmed up' you were impressed with the voices. Donizetti's music, as always is so melodic you can close your eyes, sit back and soar! The audience was enthusiastic in their applause, prolonged ovations; Leonora was visibly moved to tears after the ovation for one of her arias. The cast was excellant, choreography for ballet scene was superb. I was only slightly disappointed with the set direction and the quality of the filming of the DVD."
1,"As a skimmer who can usually finish a book in a few hours, this book was the exception. The plot was well contrived, the characters highly developed and the ending not expected. Superb!"
0,"This movie plays as if it was directed by the camera.It looks cheap is hopelessly incoherent.Stick with ""Close Encounters""."
0,"I order the book a week before it shipped and then took so long to get here I had to download the book to my daughters Kindle the night before she needed it for school. That cost me $9.99, and then got the book on the 4th or 5th of February. Won't use this one again."
1,"I felt the first book in the series started off a little weak and definitely grew in strength as the novel progressed. However, I enjoyed ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" from start to finish and went on to purchase the other titles in the series right away. My only complaint is that this book did not have a Kindle edition."

0,"I couldn't tell you how this movie ends, we turned it off after the first half-hour. Not appropriate for children, not entertaing for adults. Our dog even left the room. Don't waste your money."
1,"paper.You can really understand and feel for Ayla,her confusion, and love for these prehistoric beings. But it's hard to imagine that these ...people could be so oblivios to the more advanced ways of different people, that obviosly were going to excel in the human races...if I could I would give this book a 4.5 because I belive Mrs. Auel gave 90%"
1,Good for beginners or for those already on a spiritual path - as always another perspective gives you insights in areas you may have thought you had it all sussed or confirms something you had not quite got your head around yet. Forgiving and generous - a book to come back to.
1,"I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book."
0,"This is man-worship at its most blatant! The Tozer quotes are good, of course, but they are much better read in their context. The compiler's have seen a way to make a quick buck on Tozer's popularity and the page titles are crass, tasteless and irrelevant. The Bible verses that are supposed to associate with each quote bear little relevance, and add nothing to the quote. This is a waste of money at any price! We find on the back that this booklet is part of a series. Others in the series include Moody, Wesley, Luther, and ... Larry Burkett (whoever HE is!) Please save your money and time. This one ended up straight in the bin. To me it is worse than pure secularism and borders on blasphemy! It's sick!"
0,"I received two of this brand of mug warmer. I only ordered one, but I finally resolved the issue with Ace Hardware.I love this Mr. Coffee mug warmer. I have one at work and one at home. I don't throw away coffee like I did before, because the mug warmer does keep the drink warm. I am pleased."
0,"I specifically got this version of the movie for my husband so he could have the movie on his iphone. The code expired in September and they are still selling it to people as dvd+blu-ray+digital copy. But you cannot get the digital copy because of the expired code. If you wanted the file for itunes like we did, DO NOT BUY!!!"
0,"This book is repetitious and after several episodes, boring. Tom Brokaw should stick to reading the news on NBC. If you want a good book on this subject, read,""Citizen Soldiers."" You will not regret it."
1,"While the technical specification of JSTL is readable like most hi-tech documents are ""readable"" (i.e. it left me sometimes a bit puzzled), this book is both deep and full of very useful examples. Sometimes, in my opinion it goes too far (programming a message board with JSTL), but this only goes to show how powerful JSTL really is.Overall, I really enjoyed reading it: It made a lot of things clearer and there were a couple of times where I thought: ""Oh, I didn't know that JSTL could do that!""."
1,"Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun."
1,"I read the John Carter Martian Series all the way through in my adolecent years, and have always maintained fond memories of the stories. I recently decided to download them to my Kindle and read them again. I was amused at first by the writing (written almost exactly 100 years ago now), not so much for the phrases and words (though they are amusing at times) but the style and the way the characters are portrayed. This is truly a peek at the sensibilities of an older age.However, once you get over (or used to) the over romanticized hero, to whom no danger raises so much as an eyebrow, you will live (or re-live) a classic tale that is nicely told. It is fun as a middle aged adult to again read these stories, suspend all disbelief and scientific knowledge, and just enjoy them for what they are! John Carter made a permanent imprint on me as a kid, and I'm glad to see that it remains still."
0,"At first I thought that Fahrenheit 451 sounded very interesting, and I was glad to see that my 10th grade teachers had assigned the reading of it. By page 3 of the novel, however, I knew this was not a book I would enjoy. While it's a frightening, though thought-provoking look at the way society could become, it was extremely badly written. Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go ""inside"" Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again. I wouldn't recommend this book to a single person, and my condolances to any other student forced to waste their time on this. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the few books I would gladly toss in the fire."
0,"While I adore the first edition of Leaves of Grass, this book is not as advertised. I definitely encourage you to buy it in another edition. I returned mine with a note, so hopefully Amazon will change the description soon."
0,"I had to read this book for school (literery circles, and I made the mistake of picking this think) I'm in 8th grade, and I thought this book was rather stupid. The basic plot was fine, but the thing was like a soap opera, where everyone was with the wrong person, and of course, everyone was ever so happy at the end. I would have found this a more enjoyable book if the ending had been Kit marrying Willam, Judith becoming an old maid, and Nat marrying someone else. (Still John with Mercy though, because they deserve it.)The reason I gave this two stars is that readers 8-10 would probably enjoy this, but if you're a teenager or even an older preteen, I wouldn't recomend it."
1,it is a wonderful look at the traditions and history of goju ryu. A must for students of this art.
0,There Was Not Really That Much Sex In The Film. There was some brutal language Butr Not that much in sex. This film was not at all what they all said it to be. I myself is into love stories such as this and if your a fan like me...dont get this. but dont take my word for it
1,"SOAD is definitely different from most of the popular metal acts these days, but you probably know that if you already have their first album. The best song is Science, other highlights are Aerials, Prison Song, and Chop Suey. Other songs are also good, with the exception of Psycho and Shimmy which may be good live, but are pretty boring on the album. Its worthy."
0,"I'm serious. I can't believe I paid my hard earned cash to buy this movie. I should have been paid for the torture and wasted time. Now, I can't even get $3 for it at a store that buys used DVDs. It's not fair. Down right bad movie."
1,The product was delivered to me as described. Got what I wanted. A sturdy dowel. Who could complain about that?
1,"Honestly the guy can sing. Out of 12 songs, I would say more than half are excellent, and the others are worth listening too. Most cd's have 2-4 decent songs out of 12-15, however this one tops them all. If you think the cd could be better, I disagree. Everyhting in life could always be better, you cant change that. As a first Clay Aiken Deput album...?? well It Rocks. Worth every penny."
1,I recently purchased this item and I can't say how relaxing it feels wearing it. It's made with a high quality silk and does not stick to the body. Best part of this pajama set is that if you take turns in your sleep it really does not hold to your body as it slips through giving you that ease of turning over on your back or belly. Loved it...would like to order more...

I was jogging and the clip separated and the Walkman hit the pavement!As far as the unit as a radio is is awesome. Especially with the mega bass and pulse monitor.So if you run or jog, don't buy this unit.I called Sony and they have no fix for the problem. This Walkman is going back to the store."
0,"this video has a lot of dances for learning but each dance has only 3 steps so dont expect so much from this teaching video. if you want more than 3 steps then buy videos exclusively for a particular dance. this video will just wet your appetite but will not fill your hunger. also, the background setting of this video is very dark as if you are inside a dark night club so you cannot see the footsteps of the teachers because both of them were wearing black pants that blend with the dark background, terrible! plus the teachers teach from the side of the camera and sometimes facing the camera. this is not the ideal way to teach dance in a video. the teachers should be back to the camera so you can follow their footwork. for the money they charge for this video is not worth it."
1,"Again, Sr Mary Elizabeth O'Brien has writeen an excellent book. I give this book to nurses when they graduate. It truly puts nurses in an angelic and spiritual perspective which they deserve."
1,"This ball is made of thick and durable plastic -- seems more heavy-duty than the balls at my gym. I use it as an office chair in addition to using it for exercises. The hand pump worked fine. I followed the instructions and filled the ball half way, left it overnight and completed filling it the next day. All-total, filling the ball took only 15 minutes. They provided very clear instructions on how to measure the filled ball. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the instructions mentioned a bicycle pump needle attachment that wasn't included in my box."
0,"Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up."
0,"Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
1,"Telemann: Sinfonia spirituosa; String Concertos is a recording under the direction Reinhard Geoebel leading the Musica Antiqua Kln on this Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording from 2002. It contains a well-written essay entitled ""Georg Phillip Tellemann: A Musician Abreast Of The Times"" written by Richard Goebel and translated into English by Richard Evidon. The performance by Musica Antiqua Kln is nothing short of splendid and I thorougly enjoy this recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."
0,"How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else."

1,"I read a lot of books... and rarely have I had the experience that I had with this one. Usually I devour the language... gulp at it and after I finish a book I find that, although I enjoyed it, I didn't gain anything from the experience other than a few killed hours.This book made me slow down. Instead of reading ravenously through the pages I found myself savoring the language. I laughed, and cried, and rolled my eyes at the sarcasm and irony, and gasped, and remembered, and felt attached to the characters.I didn't read this book... I stood beside the characters and lived it with them."

0,"Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental."
0,"The poster I received is okay - it's the one with ""Planet Earth"" written in italics along the bottom, instead of EARTH - but I really would have preferred the one I chose to spend money on, especially since you can buy the one I mistakenly got for .83 instead of $5ish. However, the shipping was fast and the poster was spotless."
1,this is a very good book for the younger readers. it is straight forward and gives good halloween costume ideas for little kids

1,"This book just cries for a continuation. once started it is difficult to put down. I am lucky that i have the orginal paperback edition, that despite many readings is still in good condition. It helps if you know a bit about Indian religions."
0,I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.
0,"Charles Pellegrino, while providing interesting insight into the finding of the sunken liner Titanic, obviously neglected to do his research on that which haunts him so. As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic. This book had the potential to create a fascinating discourse between the two main events in the life of the liner, both academically and emotionally, but unfortunately it doesn't. Luckily we now have James Cameron's film ""Titanic"" to build what Pellegrino couldn't."
0,"This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!"

0,"I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from ""Billy Madison"" to ""Punch-Drunk Love"". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for ""Eight Crazy Nights"". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last."

It holds it's own and I am thankful to my parents to gift this to me as a Graduation Present. Someday I plan on buying more of these pens from Amazon.The vendors at Amazon are amazing. I have been a long time shopper at Amazon, mostly pens and electronics. However this pen was gifted to me by my mom and she has nothing but good things to say. I on my part love this pen."
0,"My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No."
1,"First of all, I never did something like this before until now and it had to be done. In my situation the bushing was broken on top. So, I opt not to by bushing removing tools or pin remover. I took 2 screw driver popped the retaining clamp and a small chisel broke the rest of .The top bushing od was a little bigger then my door post hole, is this normal I don't know. I grease od of the top busing, and used a socket of same od with extension, tap it went in smooth, I broke the bottom bushing with the chisel and the new bushing went in with no trouble maybe because hole was a little oblong from leaning. I bought 2 just in case. Good product for the price, and it worked well for me. Do u need the removing tools I can't say."

1,"Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished."

The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this."

0,BioTutor is the worst educational software I have ever purchased. I trusted the reviews that were posted and was a total fool for doing so. It is simply pretest questions with written explanations if you need them. I can't believe they consider this interactive. I could get this from doing the pretests in the back of my book. I will be sending this software back!
0,"There appears to be a good many who support this book, but none that actually ilustrates explicitly its hidden gem or genius, if there is indeed any. personally i don't see why it's so fantastic. the suspension of fixed parameters and a ""realistic"" framework in general seems to be an easy way to avoid the more prosaic elements and ensuing entanglements in life, and may also be construed as a rather cheap method to beguile readers into a seeming style and artistry."
1,"This may be my favourite Mayhem album of all. As opposed to the crude ""deathcrushing"" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of ""De Mysteriis,"" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before. Usually very fast, sometimes atmospheric (all done w/out synths, except for the ambient intro track), and always hellish - every aspect of this music is absolutely insane, and it definitely gives hope for a grim future."
0,"I rented this movie thinking it would be a sweet, romantic, relatively clean movie that I could enjoy watching. However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of ""If it feels good, do it."" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."
1,Anyone who likes Limp Bizkit and Tool but suspects that these guys are basically talentless screamers needs to dig up System of a Down. Intelligent metal isn't an oxymoron...here is an abulm that shakes your bones while stimulating your mind. Amazing.
1,lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd
1,"Despite all the hype and negativity due to popularity backlash none can honestly admit that Asimov made a mundane focus for his writing passions when he wrote and then published the stories that comprise 'Foundation'. Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers."
0,"This is the number one worst movie I have ever seen. I usually love French films and enjoy the unprudish and free attitude in most of them, but this one went too far. I wanted to leave the theatre, but I was too transfixed in horror to move. I gagged, I winced, I covered my eyes, but still I couldn't move. After the torture was finally over I felt shellshocked and needed to go home and watch The Lion King to recover. It was a glimpse into the world of a sad, demented, and twisted character that I did not need to see. There was no point to this movie and I felt that it existed purely for shock value with no lesson, point or true plot. If you value your time do not watch this movie."
0,"I have ordered this DVD four times. Picture is fine, music is fine, subtitles are fine BUT none of the received DVD has french dialogs/ actors' voices. Does somebody else have the same experience??Steve"
0,I thought there was no point to this book what so ever and i dont suggest anyone to read it...! i had to read it for school and i didnt even finish it because it was so bad!
0,The children were happy to play with it but since the electronics was so poor they were very dissappointed and left it on the table
1,"Seems to be a nicely designed and manufactured air bed. We've used it for guests a few times, and are pleased with it."
1,"I found this book enlightening not knowing anything about the current sitaution in sudan other than bits and pieces in the news. I finished this book in almost one sitting i couldn't out it down. I knew of slavery in sudan ,but had no human face or story to put with it."
1,THIS CD IS PURE MEDAL GENIOUS THE WAY THEY USE THIER VOICES AND SO ON. THE SONG DEER DANCE IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ABLM TOXICITYTHIS SONG DIDNT TURN ME ON TILL THE 09/11/01 HAPPEND IT WAS THE PERFICT SONG FOR A MACRAMEDIA VIDEO THAT I DID IT REALLY SPONSERD THE EMOTION THAT WAS FELT WHILE THE ATTACKS WERE HAPPENING. THIS IS THE BEST CD AND SO IS THE FIRST. BEST OF THE BEST
1,This book was amazing The way the author made it sad and very exciting. The book made me want to read even more. But why were the adults the only ones to die instead of the kids. The book could've been better and more sad and exciting.
1,I am a beginner and I'm teaching myself. This book was very helpful in teaching me how to begin. It also has a lot of nice designs that I was not afraid to try. I found this book very helpful in getting started.
1,"Mad Max is a very good movie.It's loaded with action,and it's got a good(but kind of strange)musical score that really adds to the feel of the movie.The plot is pretty good.It takes place sometime in the future(at least from when the movie was made)in Australia.The highways of Australia have become very unsafe,with biker gangs running wild.Most of the film is about a very nasty gang,led by a crazy guy called the Toecutter,that is out for revenge on a cop named Max,who they blame for the death of their friend the Nightrider.(he died in a fiery crash toward the beginning of the film,after an excellent chase)After the gang kills Max's wife and baby,he becomes the hunter,and the gang the hunted,and Max gets revenge in the end.This is a very good film,done on a very small budget.The only version I've ever seen is the American,I would love to see the Australian Sometime.This movie is followed by an excellent(and bigger budget)sequal,The Road Warrior."
1,"It's intelligent, insightful, and very funny. Brilliant performances by Julie Walters and Michael Caine in a story that you wish was true. I see very little that can be improved here, and it's one of those very rare films that I'll put back on my little shelf to watch again later."
0,Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
0,"My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite."
0,"This product is like chapstick. It goes on so easy. It doesn't damage nearby skin at all. You don't have to be careful with it. I have been using it for a few days, that's all. I would be amazed if it actually does anything. If it does I will come back here and say so. It seems like chapstick. So far, nothing at all."
1,Short and sweet since everything has already been said. One of the best rock releases the past 25 years. What an album
1,"I have liked this product so much that I have three of them...I fill a glass container with some smell good pine sol AND my whole home/work place is filled with the scent of clean (we have cats and no one is the wiser as they can not be smelled at all).I am thinking of ordering another one of these in a few weeks, thanks for asking!Paula Jo Carr"
0,"Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to ""Battlefield"". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake."
0,"The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point."
0,"OCP PLANS ON DESTROYING DETROIT TO BUILD DELTA CITY. BUT, WHEN A GANG OF ANGERED RESIDENTS DECIDE TO FIGHT OCP BACK, PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEMS, ROBOCOP [PLAYED HERE BY ROBERT JOHN BURKE] JOINS THE PEOPLE IN THEIR QUEST FOR FREEDOM. NOT AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, AND IT'S ALSO NOT AS GOOD. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY MADE WITH THIS MOVIE WAS TO REPLACE PETER WELLER AS ROBOCOP. ROBERT JOHN BURKE JUST SEEMS LOST AS ROBOCOP. THIS SERIES WAS SERIOUSLY STARTING TO RUN OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THIS POINT. WHY COULDN'T THEY JUST KEEP THIS ONE ON THE SHELF? ANYWAY, ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE THEY MADE WAS TO HAVE ANN, ROBO'S PARTNER FROM THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, GET KILLED. HAS A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY LACKING THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT CAME WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BUT YOU WANNA SEE IT, RENT THIS, BUT DON'T BUY THIS. FOLLOWED BY FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES."
1,"A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well."
0,"I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !"
0,"I was tired of the tabs on luvs and decided to go back to pampers, but when I tried both the cruisers and baby dry diapers this time around, they both gave my little guy diaper rash (they didn't do that a year and a half ago). The baby dry didn't do it as bad as the cruisers. I love pampers products - both the baby dry diapers and the cruisers as well (great fit, quality product), but they are useless if they give your little one diaper rash. Otherwise, amazon does a great job delivering their product."
0,This was a school assignment for my son. I read the book first so I could quiz him on it. It is in my top 5 of the worst books ever! Don't waste your time...unless it's a mandatory school assignment.
0,"This is a very cheap toy. Poor finish, sloppy tolerances. Had a slight imbalance and would vibrate and lose speed quickly. The vibration makes most of the usual gyroscope tricks impossible.Then it spun off the table and promptly broke. Perhaps that's why they offer the two-pack?"

1,This book categorizes many true and false reasons one might find himself unemployed. The book then gives commonsense directions to overcome the perceived inhibition. Great book!
0,"This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
1,This really worked out well for me! It lost a little air but that is to be expected. I use this during the holidays when extra people are visiting.
0,"I haven't used it yet!!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous, wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it. Seriously, what a waste of resources. I can't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging. Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person!!!? ah!! For a MEMORY STICK? Gimme a break!!"
0,"While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
0,"This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
1,I was surprised that after a few days use one really can tell a change in pore size without the harshness of an astringent. This is a real quick & easy effective non-irritating skin program to follow. I wish it came in much larger sizes to bring the price point down. The cost is the only factor that may keep me from future purchasing w/o a coupon or gold box discount. Actually I would like to try the entire line-so I really hope it will be featured frequently in the gold box or Friday sale.
0,"I seem to be having the same problem as everyone else. I bought this DSL modem mostly to get UPNP support for my Nintendo Wii. Worked great for the first 6 months, but I noticed lately it can't connect to the DSL provider or when it does everything crawls and eventually it looses sync. Sadly, I had to replace it with my old DSL modem (SpeedStream) which works perfectly (so I know its not my phone lines or other problems). Also, I noticed the Zoom DSL modem heats up pretty bad, wondering if theres a connection between that and its failure rate.I would definitely find another DSL modem, especially after reading all the other posts regarding the poor reliability issues."
0,"I read this book in my class and it took me forever to finish it. I am a big reader but I just couldn't get into the book. I think it should have been more exciting. In my opinion, it seemed as if the author kept repeating the same information."
1,"When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon."
0,"The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!"
0,"I bought this to keep the inside of my RV from freezing up during the week (we use it on weekends). After a power-outage of about 30 minutes, the unit failed to come back on so everything froze up. Since we are prone to brief outages, this was not acceptable. I replaced the Delonghi with a $20 space-heater and have not had another problem."

1,"""A Campfire for Cowboy Billy"" is not only a charming tale, it's a resonant one. Cowboy Billy, who looks to be somewhere between six and nine years old, lives in the city. But that doesn't stop him from riding his stick horse, Splinter, all over the place--watching out for rustlers, delivering Pony Express mail, and so on. Author Wendy K. Ulmer subtly introduces the point that Cowboy Bill's grandfather has died, and that Grandpa had once told Billy that stars are the campfires of those we love--those who have died before us. Billy takes comfort in this tale, and it doubles back towards the end to take on new resonance and meaning. Altogether a sweet and subtle way to discuss death with a child. Ulmer's story is energetically illustrated by Kenneth J. Spengler."
1,"Who said numbers have to be dull? This book was funny, very funny, when it was first published fifty years ago.It has aged well. It's still funny - and what with Enron and others having ""lied with statitics"", there's a lot that one can learn from this extraordinary little book."
0,"Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about."

0,"Item arrived with black powdery smudges on the cover and edge of paper. I don't know if it's from the laser ink powder of the packing slip, or if it's from the printing on the cover. It is acceptable but messy. Also, the photo clearly shows a set of 2 books, but there's only one as detailed in the description."
0,"Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time."
1,"I was glad to see my mother at work at MGM two years before I was born. I am 73 years old.Mother was an MGM starlet in 1934. I had not been able to find a copy of this short after it was seen in part on TCM. I wrote TCM and searched the IMDB to no avail.And then this collection appeared! It fills the bill and is probably also appreciated by William Powell and Myrna Loy fans as well.Mother stars in the short musical film ""Dancing on the Ceiling."" She plays the dentist. What is significant about this film is that it may have been the precursor to the ceiling dancing film done by Fred Astiare.This short is not associated with the Lionel Richie, Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald works of the same name done more recently.I am still looking for a copy of the first MGM Technicolor musical short which starred Mother titled ""Gypsy."""
0,"I seriously question the validity of these stories as real Victorian writing. As another reviewer mentioned, there are no background and bibliographic references whatsoever. I would at least expect approximate dates and publishers of the original texts.My guess is that they were written by a man familiar with Victorian erotica, but some time after the era ended. One clue is that one story describes the woman as a ""lesbian,"" a word which didn't come into popular use until well after the Victorian era. Sexologists began using it in 1889, but it is really doubtful that a writer of common porn would be aware of the most recently published scientific writing.On the other hand, the stories are entertaining as some ridiculous little pieces of erotica."
1,"The Call of the Canyon is another of Zane Grey's ""war novels"" which is to say, it deals with the subject of the mistreatment of returning veterans from the first world war. But it is also the coming of age of a modern ""sophisticated"" woman who learns the real meaning of love, and what it means to love someone. The story has several scenes which take place in New York City as well as at Oak Creek Canyon in Arizona. For pure romance, this book can not be beat. Carly Birch is one of Zane Grey's finest female characters, and again I will say he often wrote from the woman's point of view which is why the vast majority of his work was published in the leading ""women's"" magazines of the day, and his readership was more than half women. So, ladies, please don't dismiss Zane Grey as a ""western"" writer; he was so much more than that."
1,The more I listen to Clay's new CD the better I like it. He has a beautiful voice and I could listen to it all day. You can understand the words as he sings them which is not the case for alot of other singers. I hope he continues to sing and make more CDs but most of all I hope he finishes his education.
0,Every single night my 11 month old daughter would wet through these diapers and get her sheets completely wet! HORRIBLE buy in my opinion!
0,"this is one of the worst diapers we ever used. We have been using Papmers Sensitive and thought we will try this. Nothing is staying in this diaper.even for a small leak, it becomes very wet and we end up changing the diaper... and when she takes a poop, it just literally overflows. will never buy this again."
1,"I picked up the Kindle version of this book when Amazon made it free for a limited time, and I'm so glad they did (it worked out for Amazon too, because I purchased the other two books as soon as I finished this one). I had kind of fallen out of reading for pleasure and just bought the Kindle. This was my second book I read on it and I loved it so much that I've been reading like crazy ever since. Lawhead totally pulls you into the world he creates. The characters, environment, battles, and problems are all well developed and you end up totally engrossed. I'm glad it was a trilogy and not over after only this one book.A great read for any fantasy fan."
1,"We've tried Costco's diapers and to a limited extent, Huggies... From our experience, Baby Dry are the best at catching leaks and offer the most value."
0,"TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."
1,"After just listening to a few clips of this CD on the internet made me want this one. Now after hearing the entire CD, I am soooo glad to have one!!!! Clay's voice is truly remarkable, the lyrics great, and the music is beautiful. I recommend this highly, you won't be disappointed."
0,"Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!"
0,"This movie is UNACCURATE! Stupid! Foolish! Laughable! Not like the games! How? Here's a list of what was bad about this so-called ""movie"":*The Goombas are tiny brown mushroom-like enemies not dinosaurs!*King Koopa is human!*The Mario Bros. do not live in Brooklyn in the games!!*Bowser (King Koopa) has a wife*In the games there IS no Dinosaurcity! It's the Mushroom Kingdom*Toad is not in this movie (dumb)*Yoshi was more cartoony and can talk in the games*More than HALF of the enemy characters are missing in this movieAND MANY MORE!But don't panic you'll get a good chuckle from the EXTREME bad acting! Seriously even Nintendo hated this movie!Overall: Is Super Mario Bros. bad? Of course not! It's not a bad game! It's just a bad movie. (...) If you want a splendid adventure then stick with the games."
1,"I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."
1,"This book covers all emotions experienced by human beings successfully: rage, sadness, happiness...There are already many good reviews for this book out there, so I won't write paragraphs. I just wanted to say that this book is not for very young readers: it's maybe just a tad too realistic. After all, one does want to believe in Santa Claus for awhile. This is a book worth reading. It opened a new and deeply moving world to me which I'm not sure I want to explore further, but I probably will because Betty Smith has caught me in her web. I am searching for A Joy in the Morning, and will probably enjoy it just as much."
1,"My mom got this for me as a gift.We were going away on a trip to Florida,I get bored really easily but it kept me entertained!i think that they should manufacture all the neopets cause some other people might have other oppinions,they might want a zafara,quiggle,or a ixi they should widen the variety for all the neopets lovers!"

1,"Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation."
0,"The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it."
1,"The chapters on ""Genuine Encounter"" and ""I-Messages"" are worth reading again and again. Although this book is old, the messages are fresh today. I see parents every day who do not enjoy their children; this book encourages you to appreciate your children every day - a great gift."
0,Not bad but could have been a lot better. Overall it was dissapointing. They could have at least noted what happened to the Ori after leaving fans hanging with the series ending. Not worth buying.

0,"I found this book in the seatback on an Amtrak train from NY to DC so I don't know if it was forgotten or just left as the trash that it is. It took about ten pages to realize that it was just pure sleeze, and i gave up after getting half way through it within 15 minutes. I could slap myself for wasting that much time. I enjoy good erotica, but this is more like pulp putzing."
1,"Ever since I discovered that this was being released on dvd, I have been bursting out with retarded noises of delightful joy! I am very excited about the release of my very favorite televisionsitcom,Threes Company, because of the many laughs I get from watching it mostly. You will not regret buying it, and that is a guaranteed guarantee!"
0,"I would like to give this movie no stars but it was not an option. Don't be fooled by the indie reviews and look of this film. It is HORRIBLE! I'm a huge John Waters fan and enjoy camp and ""bad"" movies. Even John Waters would be bored with this one. The director spent too much time on looooong shots and scenes that go nowhere. Repetitive dialogue from the main character also gets annoying. Too bad! The movie could have had great potential but failed at the hands of an un-creative director."
1,"Civil War veteran John Carter is carried away to Mars. There, he impresses the giant green Tharks with his hand-to-hand combat skills, falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, and has many adventures. Very fun escapist yarn. Totally implausible, but never really asks you to take it seriously. Pure wish-fulfillment heroic fantasy. Burroughs' prose is a bit archaic and stilted, and some plot twists were too extraordinary to be satisfying. Overall, however, Princess is very entertaining pulp fiction."
1,"Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating."

1,"3 different relaxation sessions with explanations embedded within, along with hypnotic programing to help release tension, fears and any pre-programmed negatives which might be preventing pregnancy. Also programming for women who have physical problems that might be inhibiting their fertility. All designed to help remove mental blocks from the subconscious to promote healing on the physical level and mental level. Overall the sessions are very relaxing and refreshing."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is probably the single hardest job an actress would take on. I belive that people are expecting to see the actual Audrey Hepburn. That is not going to happen. Mrs Hepburn is regarded as the best actress of all time, and to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt can have the same performance is not logical. But Ms Hewitt does a wonderful job of capturing the charm and grace of Hepburn in a way I don't believe that any other young actress could do. Who else could pull off this part? In my opinion, no one else has even close to any resemblence to Hepburn compared to Hewitt. I believe this was a wonderful film and it made me even more interested in some of the classical Hepburn movies that I have not previously seen. Give credit to Hewitt for tackling such a hard film and pulling it off. A job well done."
0,"This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir! The remix WAS better."

1,"Lola is a girl stuck in a dilemna: how to save her boyfriend from being killed. So, in the spirit of Groundhog Day, she keeps repeating the day over and over again until she gets it right. But unlike Groundhog Day, this indie film has an edgy style, mixed with a punkish Lola and cartoonish pop culture animation. Without giving away too much, she somehow ends up solving her dilemna but after several crazy attempts that shed light into her own seemingly average, but soon-to-be complicated life."
1,"If you like sg-1 and the adventures dealing with time travel, this movie is quite enjoyable. Yes, some of the old sequences are there (Teal'c as first prime but wants to be free), but, new twists with Vala and Ba'al. The story still leaves open the idea that other Goaul'd may be around, but the last major god has been vanquished."
1,"I didn't much care for ""On The Road"" after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great ""Beat Writer"" was nothing but hype, but after reading ""The Dharma Bums"" I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
0,"The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing."
1,"I had the reported switching problem (""UPDATE: This device has one annoying defect ... a ""clever"" feature of switching inputs automatically when it senses no input on one of the two stereo inputs ... any stretch of silence will cause it to switch"").

0,"...Clay has an amazing voice...very clear and strong. Honestly, I just don't like the songs or his style. It's not that he can't sing. I guess he just doesn't sing the music that I like to hear. I was given this CD as a gift...why?...I don't know. It was a gift from a secret pal and I guess whoever pulled my name at the beginning of the year doesn't know me very well. If you like Clay's kind of music, you'll love this CD because he sings it well. Me? I guess I'm just more of a typical R&B fan. Love Ruben's CD...love Tamyra's CD...love Kelly Clarkson's CD...but just couldn't get with this one. Nothing personal. I probably just never should have listened to it. My bad."
0,"My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!"

0,"For the price this very simple apparatus should function flawlessly. Its one job is to hold sand. I wish I noticed out of the box that one of the edges of the bottom where it meets the frame was bowed out enough to leak sand (salty looking sand) all over my desk. Annoying. I scooted as much sand out of the way as I could to duct tape this edge on the inside. When I have the time, I'll probably dump out the sand and tape all the edges because I don't trust it.The hassle this has caused is definitely not zen."

0,"Some interesting parts to this novel, but it drags on much too long and does not translate into a good American read. Sorry, Oprah!Paragraphs can last for pages and everyone has the same names--Aureliano, Ursula, Segundo, Aradio, and Remedios. Heck, one Aureliano had 17 sons who were ALL named Aureliano. so, often times the reader cannot tell who Marquez is referencing without looking at the family tree graphic in the front of the book.Maybe I am not a deep thinker, but I found this book to be ponderous. And the story lines that are somewhat interesting are never are made clear as to their importance to the overall tale."
0,"The price is too high for a VHS tape. Also, the title is misleadig, as Latin dancing has nothing in common with Argentine Tango. If you are NOT interested in authentic Tango Argentino, and don't mind paying the high price for ballroom instruction on tape, then this video is for you."

1,"I originally bought three of these for our HD boxes, and they improved the connection with TiVo service for updates significantly. Transfers between boxes were slow, though. If we tried to watch while transferrring, unless we waited until the transfer was almost finished, the program would pause when it had to wait for the rest of the transfer.One thing that helped was relocating the router next to one of the TiVo HD boxes and connecting it via Ethernet, That nearly halved the transfer times to/from that box.I later boughtActiontec MegaPlug A/V 200 Mbps Ethernet Adapterunits for all of the other boxes and now most non-HD programs transfer fast enough that we can watch them while transferring without hiccups. HD programs still require some waiting before watching. The MegaPlugs are sold in pairs but up to 12 can be combined without a separate router if you can run a PC application."

She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over"
1,"The Descent has everything you could want in a horror film. The acting, atmosphere and gore were all top notch for this genre. Some people I went with didn't even know it was a creature film. They thought one of the girls was going to go psycho in the cave and start killing them all off. Boy were they surprised. I caught the UK ending on another website, and while I prefer that one by far, the U.S. closer wasn't too shabby either. The only thing I didn't really care for were the creatures. They were a little scary at first, but once they started showing swarms of them, they lost that creepy factor. The build up to actually seeing them was so good. I enjoyed the cave diving and crawling parts as much as the creature fest to come. Plus they weren't intimidating and hard to kill like the creature in another film similar to the feel of this one, called Alien. While I enjoyed Dog Soldiers quite a bit, The Descent is a film worthy of my horror DVD collection."

Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size."
0,"First of all, don't even bother mentioning Sixty Watt Shaman in the same sentence as Alice and Chains and Soundgarden. Cantrell has more talent in his pinky than Sixty Watt has all together. If you want to check out real Stoner Rock, Kyuss and Queens of The Stone Age are a good start. This album is mediocre at best. Red Colony seems to be the only song I could really get into. Cool album cover though! Maryland must have a really lame Stoner Rock scene, because out here in CA, Sixty Watt Shaman would go unnoticed."
0,"This is a dreadful movie. Anybody who tells you that it resembles the show obviously hasn't seen one of them. The plot is like something you would find in a kid's story book, the graphics are from the Ren & Stimpy school of animation, and the characters don't sound the same even though they were done by the same people. This is surely enough to include SPONGEBOB on anyone's list of the worst 100 films of all time. Guess that means I need to see SANTA AND THE ICE CREAM BUNNY to see if in fact anything worse for kids was ever put to celluloid."
1,Thank you for the speedy transaction in getting this to me. We truly enjoy watching them in this video. They are truly the best.
0,"What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser."
1,"As a long-time ERB fan, I have always favored the Mars series (right behind the Pellucidar series). As a youth, when I first bought the book, I had my doubts; having cut my 'martian teeth' on Pricess and Warlord. However, true to Burroughs style, the action picked up quickly and was on par with the other books in the series. A great read."
0,"... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
0,"If I wanted a map of Texas I would have purchased an atlas instead of this boring book. The author had a good idea, but despite that, the only reason I even finished the book was because I had 100 pages to go and I was too damn OCD to just leave it at that."

0,"""Invisible"" is definitely the creepiest song I have heard on the radio in recent memory. The lyrics seem to describe a stalker. Tell me you aren't weirded out when you hear:""If I was invisible/I could just watch you in your room/If I was invisible/I'd make you mine tonight"" and ""I keep tracing your steps/Each move that you make"". There are definitely some hidden messages running through the background of this song.. Quick! Hide your children!I haven't heard all of the songs on this record, but I have heard many (on the radio, watching Aiken's performance on SNL, etc..), and from them I can deduce that this is yet another generic pop compilation churned out by the bloated record-machine that is American Idol. Clay does have a great voice, though, which is a refreshing change from most of today's pop.Lyrically and musically, I give this cd a 1. Clay's voice brings it up to a 2 1/2, which unfortunately is not an accepted rating."
1,"This is a relatively inexpensive tool that will make your model making easier and help you avoid the need to be using door frames to draw lines. If you're new to model rockets, or returning after 20 or 30 years as the grown-up, here's the easiest way I can describe why you need this: you're going to be measuring and drawing lines on tubes. They need to be accurate, from end to end. There are plenty of other purposes for this item, but that will probably be the first difficult step you'll face. It's definitely worth having."

0,"This book was originally published in 1975 and boy does it feel its age. The writing is dull, flat and mindlessly repetitive. Reading it feels like a flat-footed ""Dick and Jane"" story with corns and bunions to boot. I probably should cut this book some slack because the author was probably trying to follow some educational theory of the time where children learn best to read if the text is ""X"". All I can say is ""Humph!"" Reading this little gem aloud for the first time to my little four-year-old, I had to heavily revise the text on the fly to make it even halfway listenable. The two stars comes from the drawing of birds. My little guy loves birds and loved looking at the pictures. He recognized some of the birds from our backyard. I've seen better birding books for the little ones."

0,"Reading this book, though it was very short, was an incredibly large waste of time! It was confusing, badly written and pointless. Reading a book where the plot is hidden in choppy sentences and weird Russian words contributed to my dislike of this book.

0,"This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH"""
1,"I am a huge Mapson fan and was looking forward to her new book. What ended up happening with this one, like all the others, was that I couldn't put it down until I finished. The bad girls are back and better than ever, and surprisingly, ""Rotten Rick"" is also back! The setting, the problems (and resolutions) these women have, and the story of Rick and Maddy was just so well-written, it felt real to me. What I found the most interesting was the points of view it was written from--in ""Bad Girl Creek,"" it alternated between the points of view of all the women; in this book, it took a different twist and alternated between Phoebe, Beryl, Rick, and Maddy. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about brave, feisty women and one man who eventually shows that he's not rotten. Definite two-plus thumbs up!"
0,"I recently purchased one of these cans, immediately filled it up with 3gals of gas, strapped it into the bed of my truck and took off for a 4k road trip. Never needed the gas, but upon returning home I smelled gas. Turns out it was leaking from the seams, and when I eventually poured what was left into my gas tank before returning it for a refund the remaining gas leaked all over the ground. How is this environmentally safe, let alone safe for people? Don't even think about purchasing this product. One star is too many."

Dave not only provides a simple approach to a complex subject, he focuses on the critical hazard recognition necessary to eliminate (by design) or control those hazards. His monthly Hazard Information Newsletter keeps the reader up-to-date with each hazard and its control, on a detailed basis as an extension of this book."
1,"A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends. While this book does touch on that type of fantasy, it also contains a contemporary view which gives it a flavor all its own -- a new old fantasy. Pick it up, read it. You won't soon forget it."

1,"James Alan Gardner is one of my new favorite authors. In Expendable, he has created a new and exciting universe peopled by characters who breathe and live between the pages. Some aspects of this book were predictable. However, it is still a page turner.I found it interesting that he wrote this book from the viewpoint of a female. It is written in first person perspective.The book is also a study of human nature and behavior. It has some funny bits, some poignant bits and a lot of great imagery. This is an excellent book. Honestly, it is one of the best ""first"" books I have read.Right after this book, I read ""Commitment Hour"" also by this author. Gardner's second book, it is also well worth checking out, if you can get past the premise. I'll also write a review about that book."
0,"what's wrong with ""Be Here Now""?in short, it's too longnearly every song is two, three, four minutes longer than it needs to bealso many people may have difficulty relating to the theme of egomania that runs through many of the songsor perhaps it's just that the album lacks balancenot enough variation from the grandios, lumbering anthems that make up the majority of the materialthere is nothing as bouncy as ""She's Electric"", as fast and cheerful as ""Up In The Sky"",or fast and angry ""Bring it On Down""not enough pace to counterpoint the ""Supersonic"" - style balladry"

1,"I thought Kathy Reich's first book ""Deja Dead"" was a quick, fun read, but a little sloppy. Given that the killer kept changing the method by which he killed, it was a wonder that Tempe Brennan actually solved the crime. (Aren't serial killers supposed to be consistant?) Anyway, the atmosphere was good and I'm a sucker for anything about Montreal. Which leads me to ""Death du Jour."" What a surprise to find Ms. Reich in such firm command of the genre in just her second book. She juggles several (try five) different story lines so successfully, you would think this was fifth or sixth in the series. Brava! I dare you to put this one down."

1,"""Lola rennt"" is definately one of my favourite films ever made. I especially love it because it is none of the typical German Hollywood imitations which have flood the video market for years. Indeed I have never watched a similar film. It spreads hope and makes us realise that we ourselves are responsible for our own destiny and that we always should think before we act."

0,"The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."

0,It seems the object of the writer was to see how much he could rewrite and still keep some connection to the original story. For example Blessed and Booth's characters were changed from father-daughter to husband-wife just so Lestrade would look foolish for arresting the husband for the wife's murder. Nothing in this film works so I gave it to charity. If you want an Ian Richardson Sherlock Holmes get The Sign of Four.

Much like a Father-son relationship.I usually don't like fiction tales that take place in the past,but I enjoyed this one. The only problem is that the book starts out slow. It gives you clues that keeps you guessing and wondering.For all you readers that consider yourself a slow reader, this is a great book for you. It's exciting and short. Only 107 pages. The price on the book is 8 bucks. I think it's worth it."
0,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone."
1,"A co-worker kept saying how great this CD was and how great Clay's voice was and that I would not regret buying this one, and she was so right. What a talent this young man is! I just can't listen to it enough.. Although its hard to pick a favorite out of all the awesome songs, I would have to say track #10 ""Perfect Day"" is my favorite. But you will find yourself singing along with all of them. Great job on a debut CD. Clay Aiken's voice is phenomenal, and he is what today's music needs."
0,"This book is woefully out of date with respect to both struts and the extension packages that the author created and published. Most if not all are deprecated and standard struts components are available to replace them. I made the mistake of developing code for Struts 1.3 using this book as a reference and will end up rewriting the application as a result. There was probably a time where this book made sense and it may have value as a historical reference, particularly to the author's extensions. But there is no good reason to have this book as your Struts reference."
0,"DONT BUY OR EVEN INSTALL A TRIAL OF THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL YOU READ THIS!!!I tried this program on a recommendation from the Microsoft web site, that should have been a warning right there. On install the etrust antivirus software (nothing else just antivirus) broke my Zone Alarm firewall, interrupted internet browsing and caused the system to hang up. I uninstalled it and have tried installing other antivirus programs since then but none of them will install; they keep popping up with guess what error message? That's right, please uninstall Etrust antivirus software, it is incompatible with our software. I've emailed Etrust and tried thier 'live' online chat and get no response. The software is evil, it looks like I will have to format my hard drive to get rid of it. I can find no related keys in the registry to clean by hand. Don't repeat my mistake!!!"
0,"WOW, this album is horrible!!! How can anyone with a fully functional brain buy this nonsense!!! This is contrived tripe targeted to people who don't know any better. I can't believe this type of CRAP is what people call music these days. This is safe, middle of the road JUNK! Music is going downhill and it's because CRAP like this is what sells these days. Whatever happened to taking risks in music? Not just pandering to people who are afraid of listening to music that actually challenges and provokes thought.Stop being braindead drones america and reject this manufactured sewage that american radio and record companies are trying to pass off as music. Awful just awful.......*gags*"

0,"One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."

His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend."

The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]"

1,"Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book."
1,Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection (Manhattan Melodrama / Evelyn Prentice / Double Wedding / I Love You Again / Love Crazy)Is there a better way to spend the day than with the charming Powell or the beautiful & witty Loy. The best ever coupling of two hollywood stars. If you enjoy watching class in action or witty dialogue you will love these 4 movies especially Manhattan Melodrama that has the extra bonus of the wonderful CLARK GABLE.

1,"I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in."
1,I can't remember if I reviewed these or not. I bought two so I may have review one. If so I would like to add to that. At first I was a little disappointed in how the coffee wasn't kept as hot as I would like it. All in all I still like it because I drag out drinking a cup of coffee over a long period of time but dislike cold coffee. This improved this issue a lot. Later I happened to cover my mug with a cardboard coaster to keep dust out while I dusted (Yea my computer room doesn't get the care it should from me. About an hour later I remember it and took a drink and was surprised to find the coffee almost has hot as out of the pot. Needless to say I keep a Cardboard coaster handy. Plastic doesn't work well water drops form on it and get all over the desk. I highly recommend These to anyone who dislikes luke warm drinks.
0,I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
1,Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.
1,"To my unsophisticated ear the Recepter's sound is full and rich. I like the way they've implemented the station pre-sets. They're accessed via a rotary knob, not a lot of hard to find buttons, and you can mix AM and FM stations among then presets. The clock radio shuts itself off after 10 minutes and can be combined with an alarm. In general, I like the Recepter's controls and user interface. I also own a Kloss Model One, another outstanding piece of equipment, and the Recepter has comparable sound quality, which is saying a lot. The Recepter has the edge in ease of use and the Model One lacks a clock radio. One drawback, the Receptor lacks an audio-in jack, so you can't attach an IPod. The Kloss Model One permits attachment of the IPod. Overall, I highly recommend the Receptor."

While steaming some tamales last night, not only did the pot turn my oven covers completely black (currently soaking in baking soda and vinegar) but upon further review the bottom lip of the pot is completely separated from the remainder of the pot.

0,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking."
0,"This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. ""Tower of Blood"" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"

That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information."

If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault"

0,"I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason."

It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres."

0,"The book is definately a disappointing follow-up from Mail Order Bride. Its so hard to like Annie, who is out for herself and very immature. Usually in historical romances a 20 year old is a little more mature. So it makes it difficult to root for her and Colin, when all you want to do is smack her in the head.I love Maureen McKade's books, and I would tell you to read this, just to get closure from the whole Trevelyan tale. But man oh man, Kate and Trev raised a brat!!!!!! I expected way better. Sorry, Ms. Mckade..."
0,"To call this movie stupid does not do it justice enough. It's beyond stupid and it's an insult to the people who write for the comic that it's based on. Keanu Reeves literally stinks up the screen with his worse performance ever and the script helps him in spades. The special effects are just awful and the direction is just off center in a lot of places. There are some points about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou that make this film a little better than what it is but other than their grand efforts to be better than the script, the movie just falls apart in every area excerpt their performances which is in fact better than the film itself.I hold much respect for the efforts made by Weisz and Hounsou but not even divine intervention could have saved this movie."
1,"Bradbury is a master of the genre. In ""Fahrenheit 451"", he once again shows his literary genius. Proving points such as ""knowledge is thy strength, fear is not thine strength"". He shows the importance of the written word and the dangers of censorship. This book made me think, which is contrary to this book. It made me think about how much we take for granted, even if it is just thinking. As they say, an oldie, but goodie. Not to be missed"

0,"I first discovered Mrs. Schlafly about two years ago when I caught her, quite by accident, on a news program speaking about her infamous book THE POWER OF THE POSITIVE WOMAN. I laughed. I thought it was a joke. Too bad it wasn't--I've read that one too. Mrs. Schalfly does it again with her most recent book, telling only one side of the story and basing her argument on the Word of God, to which she apparently has more authority than anyone other than the attendees at the Last Supper. This book is definitely worth a read--it shows the serious conservative flaws with the cry of ""activist judges!"" Once again, all she's really done is shown the world that what she's saying really isn't worth saying at all. But God Bless America for recognizing her right to say it. Read it, but don't buy it. Check it out from your local library."

0,"TiVo, when new is a great toy. But after the first year I questioned it's worth before renewing the subscription. What did it do? It copied programs, provided a program schedule, provided speed control Slowmo etc. and would record shows following what you choose. If you have cable or satellite you already have a program guild and after a few months of use I turned off the selective recording, ask it to record football and any program with foot and ball gets recorded and in less than a week your 80gig is clogged. So I let the service lapse figuring that I could record the programs manually, if there was ever any over time it always cut it off. Well no, if you do not subscribe that function is turned off and your TiVo unit becomes a boat anchor. No if I decide to get into the DVR market again I will use the Satellite of Cable DVR, same functionality for the same about the same fee and I don't have to pay hundreds of dollars for a boat anchor."

0,"Like all great Rock Groups who made several albums together Queen had some misfires. Hot Space is one such misfire. After the excellent The Game provided Queen with a major disco style hit in Another One Bites The Dust Queen decided they would make an album largly steeped in a Dance/Disco sound but the songs are not as good. This album fails with the exception of the songs that do not take this approach Life Is Real, Under Pressure, Los Polabras De Amor, Calling all Girls and Put Out The Fire."

My favorite song changes daily, even hourly, and I love every track on the CD!! I can't remember this happening since Carole King's Tapestry, umpteen years ago! I love romantic, sing-along-able songs and this CD is loaded with them. Not enough edge, some critics are grousing?? Hey, there's more nerve-grating edge than I can bear in today's music world; give me more, more, more of this kind of music, and I'll buy as much as I can possibly afford, for myself and for gift-giving!"

1,"I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy.....Diane Lane is a favorite of mine. Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all."

0,"Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music."
1,"I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and without meaning to, rediscovered the world around me. That's what truly great literature can do; transcend its status and color a person's view of the world like some life changing event, a birth or a death.Clearly I have personal feelings towards this book, but, to put it simply, this is the novel that made me love literature. In the past I appreciated good writing. I had my degree in English, was prepared to throw down over Moby Dick as needed, but I never loved literature until I discovered the Buendia's and Macondo.What I had been missing was what so many modern writers fail to get across-the mystery of life. Garcia-Marquez solves no riddles and answers no questions. In fact, he doesn't really ask any questions. That's not why he writes. On the contrary, Garcia-Marquez is just a simple storyteller, plying his trade, lolling around in the melodrama of life."
1,"Flyboys has been severely critisized for being historically inaccurate. However, for all other reasons this is a great film. The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film. So if you don't worry about the historical inaccuracy, this is a film you will enjoy. Join me next time for my reveiw on the 2004 film National Treasure."

0,"This power adapter charges my 17"" Powerbook G4 excruciatingly slowly and, now 6 months after purchase, it doesn't always even charge.Flakey charging issue: Recently, I have to keep unplugging and replugging from the middle block to get power to the computer! So now I guess I'm going to have to buy a new Apple power adapter for approximately $80.Slow charge issue: My computer gets down to about 80% charged and it can take a couple of hours to power back to 100% (while I'm using it). I'm wondering if it charges more slowly because the cord that goes into the wall has two prongs instead of three. ??? I never had problems charging quickly with the Apple brand."
0,"I really liked this briefcase until one of the buckles broke. I contacted the company that shipped the bag, something like 'Sports Accessories', not Rawlings. After 3 months of poor communication (and after I sent them the broken buckle upon their request even though I had offered to just buy a new buckle) they informed me that their service department was closing. I asked them to return the broken buckle, but no response. The story is longer than this, but as a result of horrible customer service, I now have a briefcase that i cannot use."

It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all."

1,"Being a fan of progressive rock, at first listen I didn't think much of this album because it didn't sound like there was much there. Don't make the same mistake! Don't be fooled by this album's simple sounds. They belie a complexity of story and emotion - an honesty that permeates every note on this album and is beautifully woven into a harmony of voice and guitar. This is a great album that is also well recorded - nuff said!"
0,"Let me give you some advice that will keep you from pulling your hair straight out of your scalp... stay away from this game. Don't take just my word for it... alot of folks here feel the same way. Do not listen to those that tell you that all this game needs is a killer machine to run. Believe me, I have a good machine and the controls are still awful! You get tired of yelling at Lara, telling here to get her butt up them stairs! People around you will think your nuts for screaming at the screen. Laura has never looked better, that is true. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's sure nice to look at, that is for sure. But, even if had a ghost of a chance of making Laura go were you wante her to go, you'd still have to deal with bugs, freezes, Laura walking on air, and attrocious angels. Do yourself a favor... stay away."
0,"I have read all the reviews, before, and again after, since my unit crapped out...It lasted 6 months, light use. The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers, never used all at once, maybe two pair, and it just crapped out after 6 months. The fuse wasn't blown, the lights still came on, it just stopped working. I had my doubts on a $100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true. I am looking at other brands now."
1,"Having never dabbled much in wireless connectivity for a computer, much less for my Tivo, I was a bit nervous when we moved to a house where I couldn't connect my Tivo directly into my router. All of my online research also indicated that the Tivo was pretty finicky when it came to wireless connectivity.With that in mind, I bypassed other wireless bridges and bought the Tivo version. I can't say for sure that the other bridges wouldn't have worked, but the Tivo one works nicely. I was pretty apprehensive, but I just plugged it into the back of my Series 2 Tivo. I just had to change a setting on my Tivo and enter my WEP (or is it WPA? I can never remember) password. Bingo - everything worked like a charm.It was easy - as easy as electronics stuff SHOULD be but never is."
0,"Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the ""off"" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer."
0,"Well I do like the music for the most part, it's well thought out in places. However what drives me nuts about this cd is that I don't think the band as a whole can think of more than 5 words per song. I mean come on, I mean come on, I mean come on I mean come on. See, that drove you nuts and so will this cd after a few listens. They constantly say the same thing over and over again. A note to System boys, PLEASE WRITE MORE LYRICS WITH YOUR SONGS!!!!!!!!. The music rocks and the production is very good, just write some more meaningful lyrics please!!2 Stars may be a bit tough I'll admit, but these guys have something here and they should really try and explore it a bit more on the lyrics side of things as it would truly be awesome then. I'm sure they could tweak it a bit without losing the humor that really is System's secret weapon."
0,Purchased this item and it caught on fire during its first use. I had it plugged in for about 3 minutes when my sons bottle and product caught on fire. I do not recommend this item. When I called the company they requested that I spend my own money to return the item and if they found that it was a mechanical failure they would replace the item only after I paid shipping. When I asked about my bottle they said their was nothing they could do about my loss. (Fire had caused the bottle lid to fuse to the bottom)This product is not worth a penny.
0,"My kids both wore Pampers. The last few times I've bought Pampers for my youngest they fall apart so easily. He doesn't even wear them that long before he has stringy diaper hanging off. I tried to chalk the first box off as maybe its a defective box or that he is so active. But after 3 boxes I know longer believe it. It doesn't leak, but just seems to fall apart (hard to describe) no matter if he's worn them for 5 min or longer. I can't wait until he is fully potty trained so he won't need them anymore. I am very disappointed"
1,This one's much more entertaining than the other Batman movies. It's a good story based on Bruce Wayne's sincere desire to see justice done and his willingness to lose all to accomplish it. There wasn't too much sensuality although Katie Holmes wore some tight shirts and it must have been chilly on the set.
1,I read an article about Ben Franklin in a local newspaper a few years back and was always wondering if the article was correct historically or if it was a lot of religious fiction and the writer did a poor job of writing as she did not seem to have her facts straight.I am not all convinced that autobiographies are 100% correct as the writer (ghost writers) have a book to sell and making it interesting may be more on the platter that correctness. In any event you will enjoy reading this version of Ben's autobiography to find out a little more than the history and religious writers have written.

1,"I feel that all religions have pieces of the truth and it is up to us to find them and learn. And yes men and the churches do believe that only they are worthy and women ate thereto serve them and do the menial things that they find beneath them. But if you read the old testament women have important roles that God requests of them, men ate the ones who have the most trouble believing and following that they have to prove themselves more often. Faith, love, acceptance of others as they are is really the bottom line and will bring peace if only mankind could learn and embrace that truth."

0,"I like platformers, which is why I got this game. I've played it off and on for a week now, only because I hate not finishing something I start. If it weren't for that fact, I'd never touch this game again. The graphics are good, but the camera controls are [bad]. I've died more than once because the game decided to adjust the camera angle while I was in the middle of crossing some tiny bridge or climbing a narrow ledge."

1,Attach to your TIVO and it works very nicely. I have two TIVO's so I can transfer between them both.
1,This is a great product overall. I was looking all over the place to buy these from stores but could not find it anywhere. My wife and I wanted to use these because the baby had used them while in the hospital and there is no washing or maintenance involved. However they are a bit pricey and the flow is fast relative to other nipples.
1,"I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing."
0,"I used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label. The company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me. In that case, I could have purchased similar item at Walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if I was not satisfied. I would have sent this item back. However,shipping cost was too much."
0,"This is the worst dating book ever for catholics. The author believes that dating should be mechanical and leaves little space for God's grace and healing.And you are to kiss once you get married not before. Perhaps it's an american custom as the author is american. Avoid at all costs, it was a waste of money. Better get 'The Question' rather than this book."
0,"This movie was so awful, I felt compelled to warn others NOT to rent it & certainly not to buy it. Sorry, but this was a stinker. The battle sequences were OK, but they weren't enough to overcome the shallow & predictable ""plot""--there were these incredibly long, boring stretches where the cardboard characters kind of looked at each other and muttered horribly cliche, stale dialogue. It didn't try to be realistic; I found myself going ""Oh yeah, right"" countless times. This really is a waste of time & money. save yourself!!!Or dont say that I didnt tell you."
1,"Thanks for giving me such a great product. I could not tell that this CD was used at all. It was taken very well care of. No scratches, skips or anything! Keep up the good work!"
0,I am in complete agreement with the viewer from MN as to the unfortunate full screen format this DVD version was produced in. What a blunder! What a loss of visual information so important to the script! I have had to make a VHS recording off of TCM when THEY presented the movie in its' Letterbox format. I hope someone smartens-up and rereleases Moonstruck on DVD that delivers all the great cinematography.
1,"Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native, she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel, the mother's character, at parts, seemed much like my own mother: Having a dream of a better existence, but having it crushed by a woman whose dreams have also been diminished. And thus, a vicious cycle within a society of women who never seem to truly live; instead, only exist to raise other crushed little girls to yield even more unfulfilled woman.Don't look for any made-up or whimsical fantasies here. You will find yourself precisely where little secrets lie. . .in places you will only visit by way of Kincaid's chariot."
0,"Zero. That's how many stars this gets. Why? There is a ream of evidence suggesting that this entire EP was taken from draft to final cut in one ... afternoon.... I previewed ""Baby's Got a Temper"" ... The wonderfully creative lyrics play out again and again: ""We love rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. We take rohypnol. She's got rohypnol. This baby's got a temper. You'll never get her.""Prodigy has produced quite a bit of good material, most of which has little or no actual message. ..."
0,"This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase."
1,"This is a gripping tale about two men.One is smart while the other is slow.The retarded one is named Lennie and the other is named Geroge.Lennie has the IQ of a 8 year old.George has to look out after Lennie and can't seem to leave him alone for a few seconds.Lennie infacuation with soft things,get's him in trouble.One time already George has to get them out of a predicament because of this.This is a really a good book and I would reccomend it to any Teen,becuase I have read this book in school,and I am in the eight grade.YOu have to be mature to read this or you won't fully understand it!"
1,"This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie."
1,Really like this product and love the price. My daughter is expecting her first and am getting ready for the new baby. Love it!!
1,I have been a fan of Stargate from the beginning. This movie was excellent. I would highly recommend it.
1,"The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. While there are some changes from the book, the film does stand on it's own."
0,"This product did not work for me. Even though the active ingredients are the same as name brands, the formulation seems to be different. For the price, you might want to try a bottle to see if it will work for you."
0,This was suppose to be a new DVD however it does not work very good. We had to go to the video store and rent one from them to watch it.
0,"Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."

1,"I read this book years ago. All of the books in the Land of the Free series are excellent historical fiction. My husband was a longtime resident of a coal-mining area who has 4 generations of miners in his family. He also holds a master's degree in history, and he agrees that this is a great novel about children working in the coal mines in (I think it was) the late 1800s."
0,"While the memorex CD player did impress me with it's ability to read through scratches in the CD, it had absolutely no anti-skip protection. Simply riding in a car sets it off at least once a minute. I would definitly recommend spending another $10 or $15 dollars to get a product with anti-skip protection!"
1,Well I read this book in the following reasons. TO learn about more in socialism and communisms differences and to learn a different point of view. I guess this book applies to every different reader something different because it holds many values and the values can be undestood from many ways. In simple quotes many things were hidden to find out them was like a puzzle for every reader I guess. I thing this was a book that I really liked to read and also I would like to share my ideas with other readers of this book and other readers of books related to this topic.
1,"I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done."
1,"I wish I were more proficient in Spanish so as to be able to read this novel as GGM put it to paper. I can't even begin to compare the prose, the images invoked, to any other writer I've been exposed to; they just don't compare to Marquez. I'm reading it for the 4th or 5th time and can't put it down. The words just seamlessly fall into place in snyc with my thoughts and imagination. That part of this novel is a wonderous experience. As to the content, the Buendias are a family I've become familiar with and increasingly revolted by. Behind all of Marquez's dense fog of magical prose is the sick reality of this family. I understand the intent, but didn't really pay it any attention until the 2nd reading or so. It's animalistic, barbaric, incestuous, and callous; it's a fairly tale on heroin. If you enjoy the style and prose this will be one of your favorite books, but you'll only know if it clicks with you if you give it a try."
1,I think this album is brilliant--awesome music!! Can't turn it off!!! Especially love Allegratango!!! Adiemus could sing to the sound of a washing machine and still sound good! Kudos!!!
0,"The notch where you insert the handle will break fairly quickly. I was using this product to store wires and other small electrical tools, weighing in no more than 6 pounds. After a week of use, (and only picking up the box twice), I heard a crack and saw that a piece of the rim broke off, and now the handle does not stay in place. I can only imagine what happens when you fill up this organizer with paper, which is much more heavier and denser..."

0,"I've never read Hellblazer before, but I am a comic fan and thought maybe I'd enjoy this movie. I was wrong. This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen, especially by Keanu Reeves and Shia LaBeouf. Aside from that, it contained a storyline that was just too much for a 2 hour movie. It's obvious that Constantine's life is more complicated than can fit in their time slot, so it appears they left many things out and tried to pack in as much action as possible without explaining very much.Overall, the storyline was incredibly boring, and despite some decent special effects, the action was even more yawn-inducing. This is the first movie in my entire life I've ever fallen asleep in."

0,"They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it."
0,"The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad."
0,"Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."
0,This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.

1,"After missing theirr recent Toronto concert at the phoenix (sold out in 20 minutes!), and reading reviews, I had to buy this CD. So I did... I liked the first album but I LOVE version 2.0. Everything from the clever Album title to the amazing mix of wonderful songs made me fall in love with garbage for real!!!If you're at all unsure about garbage, just buy this CD and see what happens.... But don't forget to get your concert tickets as soon as they go on sale!"

1,I've had this cookbook for a number of years and bought it as a gift for my nephew and his new bride. They love the recipes. I have never had a bad recipe from this book and it's all with health in mind.
0,"So was the movie chilling or frightening? The answer is no. I didn't like the movie at all. I may have seen the Exorcist too many times but I think that the movie wasn't scary enough to keep me satisfied. It wasn't a surprise that I was dissappointed after seeing it. It's absolutely not a horror movie only a good psychic thriller. I think that the fault is all Ira Levin's and his original book. Well, he has never been my favourite writer. Of course Roman Polanski is a good film director and Rosemary's Baby were a nice sightseeing into New York in the 60's. But it offered me nothing else."
1,"These guys are really really freaking good, and even better in concert. Normally, with a lot of CD's, if you listen to the whole thing a couple of times, you pick out songs you like more than others, and are able to narrow down your playlist to the ""better"" tracks on the album. Not so with The Matches. After roughly 9 months worth of listening, I am still hard-pressed to pick out a ""best"" song on it, because they're all really good. This would have to be one of the best punk CD's I own. Download the free mp3's on their website, and listen to them. If you like the samples, then you'll love this CD too."
0,"This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
0,This was written very poorly and it is not worth your time to buy or read.I wasted 6 days to get this book and then spent 5 minutes reading the book then it took no more than one minute to decide to return the book to get a refund.This story is a complete waste of time!
0,"I have to admit. I have so high of expectations for Mr. Michener that when he doesn't hit a home run I'm disappointed. This book is OK, it is short compared to all his other books. He only used his old trick once where he reintroduces a character, the one feamle of the book, then brings her back. She was introduced, forgotten, then found stranded in literally nowhere, and rescued by the heroes. Also something different in this book was a chapter of reflection by the author. Many claim the book is about Canada. I sensed very little Canadian, except for the fact that they were traveling through Canada. I believe Mr. Michener could of detailed the Canadian characters a bit more, showing how they came to and adapted to this rugged country."
0,"I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking of. I'm a fan of Ian Richardson but he's awful in this and this version of the story is likewise awful.

0,"My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
1,"Ghostface - The Pretty Toney Album (Def Jam, 2004)He may have removed the ""Killah"" from his monkier but that doesn't mean that Ghostface doesn't kill it on this album. Actually, from start to finish the album is pretty solid, but what do you expect from the most consistent Wu member? There aren't any Wu collabos on here (though RZA produces a track and Dirt McGirt shows up for some adlibs); instead, find Ghost rapping with the Ghost (Styles P., that is) and an even hungrier Sheek Louch on ""Metal Lungies"" and Jadakiss on ""Run"", a track so hot that Kiss said he ""may have to take his shirt off"". Even the duet with Jackie-O (who I admittedly thought would be a one-hit wonder by now) on ""Tooken Back"" comes off nice. The only duet that's average is the ""this-one's-for-the radio"" track, ""Tush"" with Missy Elliott. Otherwise, newcomers and Wu/Ghost fans should be satisfied. -EJR"

1,"In this book, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the book to our eyes. 451 takes place in a distant future far from our time. In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book. I would reccomend it for anyone who is willing to give it a try."
1,"I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
0,"In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs."
1,I bought two stations and two sensors for the outside of our house. I can now hear when anyone comes to the house in both my bedroom and other end of the house. The sensors work great and do not give any false alarms when set up properly. Set up of the units is very simple. Being able to add up to six sensors per station works excellent and being able to have each sensor send signals to both base units is great. The range of the wireless is very good also. I highly recommend the voice alert for anyone trying to protect there outside perimeter.

0,"Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."

The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"

0,"I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats, but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."
1,I got the movie on time and everything brand new the problem is I thought it would work in my samsung surround sound HD theater but it didn't. I can't really tell you anything other than I wish I can see how good it looks LOL. You will get your DVD on time though
1,"The hand held electronic 20 Questions game is one of the most entertaining little gadgets I have ever seen. It's fun to play by yourself or with a group of people, and because of it's size, you can take it virtually anywhere. I have taken mine on outings with friends to restraunts, bars, houses and even camping! I would recomend it to anyone."
0,"No piece of hardware should be as painful to use as this was. Not a bad printer when it worked -- but between the expiring ink cartridge issue, which a web search will tell you more about, functions that were dead on arrival, flaky tech support, paper feed issues, expensive ink, bloated hardware, and a scan/copy button that did nothing, it didn't work often enough. It does have an ethernet port, but there's no point in networking a printer that doesn't print. Also, if you get stuck with vague cartridge errors, removing one of the two ink cartridges may be a work around. Not acceptable performance, though.This printer's about to go the way of Old Yeller, and be replaced with something that actually prints."
1,"The author helped launch the first credit card in the 1950's. He describes in detail the many bad things that have happened from Americans becoming too reliant on plastic, living beyond their means. Should be required reading for all high school students!!!!"
1,"what more can you say, keeps the coffee in the mug warm. This is a great gift to give people at work."
1,"Very good air mattress, have had many friends come and stay on it and it hasn't lost much air. Would recommend it if you need an air mattress for visitors."
0,"Unfortunately, I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order. I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school. (Report is due Oct 25) and to date, October 9, I have NOT RECEIVED it yet. When I contacted the vendor to report last week, I basically received a ""sorry for your luck, but once it leaves our hands, we really don't care"" type of response. Totally not impressed."
0,"During the first chapter of the book. It hooks you right away. From the moment the characters arrive at the barn it declines. If you have ever seen ""Pinky and the Brain"" these are the characters. Except Lennie is more stupid than Pinky! My two year old cousin has more common sense than Lennie. The book is highly illogical."
0,"This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth."
1,"This book, is a personal favorite. I started to read it and could not put it down for the life of me. Mr. Steinbeck did an amazing job and has written a spectacular novella. If there were one book I could recomend to anybody, this is it. The tale of Lennie and George is one with laughter, tears(the book brought me to them), and truth about the cold heartedness that exists in the human factor."
1,"Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, and Fats Waller. That line up alone is a historic line-up. This was a major accomplishment to bring this cast together in 1943. A treat for the whole family."
0,"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
1,This book was required reading at least twice in grade school and I never complained. Something about it made it an instant classic in my mind. I fell in love with the characters!! It's short and sweet but still a wonderful read.
0,"So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result."
0,"I could bet a lot, that all those 5-star ratings to this album are written by (you-know-who) staff!This album is really weak, believe me. It's incredibly weak! The melodies are in a weird arabic (wrong orientation nowadays, after 9.11) style, the lyrics are utterly meaningless, solos are non-existant, guitar melodies are really primitive and the singer has one of the worst voices I have ever heard with this stupid accent, that he purposely stresses in every song. Besides that, all the songs are prolonged as possible, just to cover those poor 40+ mins of the album with one of the worst cases of hardcore.It's NOT worth a buy, really! The whole album leaves a sense of a group that have hurried their release, just to scrapp of some money on it."
0,"I'm a good hoola hooper, but when it comes to the super advanced stuff that they are doing..NO WAY! Popped it into my dvd player once, I don't even know where it is now. I was so hard!"
0,I was happily working through the exercises in this book when suddenly on page eleven the Christian references began. Since I had written in the spaces provided I could not return it. It may be a fine book but if you are not Christian I suggest you try one of the other anger self-help books.
0,"This book is an absolute waste of money. I have more than three years of programming experience in procedural languages like COBOL. I am familiar with C. I am familiar with basic OO concepts. I thought I was an intelligent and competent programmer. This book did its best to destroy my confidence.To be frank: this is the worst programming book I have ever come across. It gives you half baked ideas, and keeps them that way. Before a concept is fully grasped, the author goes on to say something else in an equally vague manner. If you can find even one single concept clearly explained in this book, you are lucky.Bottomline: This book is great for you if your ambition is to drop a few heavy-sounding technical terms in a gathering of programmers who are not so comfortable with Java. If your ambition is to learn and master a new language from scratch, look elsewhere.P.S. The sale of this book is a classic example of what media hype can do."
1,"I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""
1,"A cheerful little product. Well made, well priced, and well cooked. Cleaning is easy, and the cord storage is wonderful (automatic retracting power cords should be a law for all small appliances). I haven't had any troubles of any kind."
0,"I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price, but expected something that worked. EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper. I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results. If you do decide to buy, 1) ensure the store will accept returns, and 2) be prepared to pay return shipping."
0,"It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
1,"This is a great computer, but unfortunately it only uses Windows----which I have a Mac. It is a good printer, but make sure you have Windows before purchasing or it's a big hassle.BTW--it's B&W; only & works very well!!"
1,"Good movie. Rappaport should be getting more rolls. Sort of along the lines of ""eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"""
1,"I have a taurus .38 special and it fit. i did modify it a bit after i recieved it. i cut some of the velcro off which enabled me to be able to pull the gun out with one hand. i also had someone stitch another line of thread to have the gun sit up higher in the holster. i have a 2"" barrel and it would stick out 1/4"". however for the price this works well. i also have small legs and the velcro strap fits tight around my ankle."
0,"It was great at first, but after a few weeks of light duty, it will no longer feed the paper. It keeps saying it is out of paper, but it isn't. If I ""nudge"" the paper with my finger, it will print.Oh well, I should have known better than to give HP another chance."
1,"If you've played the games, then you are familiar with the story. The anime is about as good a representation as you can hope for. The story in the game is pretty complex, and the anime stays pretty true to it. There is a lot of stuff to cover and it is hard to do it in 13 episodes. We do get a little information about Shion's past, and the whole thing with Jr. and Albedo. So the animation explains the basics. I think it should have been longer though. All in all I really like this series. The animation in and voice actors are all good. The soundtrack is good too. The quality of the game is definitely not lost in this animation. Like I said before they should have made it longer, it's an unfinished piece of work. It could have an epic feel like the game did if they made another season. Even as it stands, Xenosaga is a good anime that is worth watching."
0,"Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better."
0,"Everyone knows that a good strategy game involves somewhat of a steep learning curve and an advanced difficulty level. This game is simply a click and attack real time strategy that does not involve any heavy thinking. In fewer words it's the bunnie slope for youngsters that are just discovering the thrill of these games. In conclusion I feel the word strategy is innapropriate altogether! True strategy players will want to return the product, rookies will like it because they'll feel moderately challenged by it."
0,"This is the worst film I have ever seen made by and about Chinese Americans. It may be of interest to people of mixed Asian ancestry since most of the cast is of mixed race. The premise may have been taken from an episode of ... Little House on the Prairie(!) wherein Charles helps a woman fake her own funeral to bring her ""distant"" kids home to see her."
0,A little bit slow at some points but other than that pretty good. I like the part where mercy is in love with John
1,"Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once."
1,"Great little overview of this amazing missionary's life. It is a very slim vloume at only 128 pages and can be read in an evening. I wept several times while reading it and recommend this book to all. It is a great example of the transformation Christ works in a man. It is a great portrait of a heart that is in fire for Christ and His gospel. It is an excellent introduction to missions and what a missionary must be like. The suffering this man went through will bewilder the mind as the uncompromising passion and dedication to seeing Christ proclaimed challenges the depths of your soul to live every moment as if everything depended on it. Can't say enough about the work God did in this man. This should be required reading for all Christians. As a note, I do plan on getting To the Golden Shore as it goes much more in depth into the life of Judson than this short but inspiring read."
1,I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!
0,"Is a copier expected to last more than a year or two? Purchased in spring 06 - In Oct 06 I had problems with thick black lines in my scans & copies. The fix was to remove ink cartridges, disconnect machine from surge protector, powercycle three or four times, wipe copper connects, put them back in, reconnect to computer, start it all again. It worked. Problem recurred now 5/07 only this time 2 big black lines. Got out my copy of troubleshoot, tried it again to no avail, Warranty is expired and I'm told it is a hardware problem. I feel ripped off. Stay away from this HP product."
1,"Mercy starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final surprise.Lots of fun to read, lots to think about. Mercy was hard to put down. I enjoyed the Palma character.I would recommend to anyone who likes a good detective story. I have passed it to several friends who also enjoyed it."
0,"I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera."
1,"i agree that pitchshifter has changed from their previous album, but i wouldnt go so far as to say they sound anything like limp bizkit (thank god), as one of the previous reviewers said. the entire cd is listenable, but some are quite a bit better than others. i would choose tracks one and seven as my favorites. as good as this cd is, it isnt as good as www.pitchshifter.com. i hope their style of music influences some other bands, because it can be a beautiful thing. heheh."
1,"This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book."
0,"I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful."
1,I use this to push my outdoor and upstairs speakers that have a higher (needs more power) sensitivity than my living room and dining room speakers. I take the tape out feed from my main receiver and plug it into the inputs of the Amp 100. The quality is amazing for the price; this thing is solid! I don't know if it is audiophile sound but I am not using it for that purpose and not pushing audiophile quality speakers with it. The product is absolutely perfect for what I am using it for. I highly recommend it to augment a whole house music system.
1,"I'm researching how a housewife would have lived during the Civil War era. Although The American Frugal Housewife edition that I read for free on my Kindle was from the 1830s, much of it probably remains unchanged 15 to 20 years later. People in villages or living in the country at that time would still have stored their foods for winter in the same way as this book advises. The treatments for croup, a burn or other illness give insight into the hardships encountered when there were few doctors and the family had to self-treat as much as possible.Fascinating details of a bygone era that is particularly useful to me as I work on my book about my Civil War ancestor."
0,"Found it stupid and annoying. This pretends to be a documentary made 5 million years into the future sent back to the present day, supported by bad computer graphic fantasy animals. In a word, pretentious."
1,"This is a nice tool for beginners and intermediate level learners of MSA, but if you've been studying for a while you will find this a bit frustrating. The 4000 words utilized are good, but they won't take you to the next level. The lists are good, but it would be nice to be able to make your own. A section of Arabic proverbs would be very useful as well, as knowing them makes a real difference when dealing with native speakers. I would pay $25 for this, but no more."
0,"I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!"
0,Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.
1,"This book is worth it for the early discussion on the Catholic faith and then Dr. Schreck's discussion of Justification by faith and works. If you are like me, you might have a Protestant view of salvation. For me I could never quite reconcile this view with the book of James. If you are not quite sure of the Chhurch's position on faith, grace, works, salvation, etc., this book places it all in perspective and clearly explained. Th eother parts of the book were interesting, but not like the first third of the book."
1,I have this book on order. Of course I haven't read it yet but I have all of her books. I read them at least 2or 3 times a month. Keep up the excellent work. Thank you for the stories that women can daydream to.
0,"Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
1,"On the peaks of the High Siera, Kerouac's narrator, Japhy Ryder explores the inner nuances of one's thought processes and being, away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay area's consternative environs. Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it. A great read showing the inner exploration and sanctity with which Kerouac grounded his Bohemian lifestyle."
0,"First time I tried the extractor, it busted off inside the bolt. Very hard metal, but so hard that it is quite brittle. Very little amount of free play, and doesn't let you put any torque on the bolt at all, so if it is rusted in there, forget about this set! Seems like a cheap knock off of the ever so popular ""easy out"" set.Now I have to figure a way out how to get the stupid thing out of my bolt so I can drill a new hole and tap some new threads in. Can't drill it out because the metal is so hard, it is chewing up my drill bits."
1,this is a must have book for people who are attracted to the moon energyI find the moon spells in this book make magic look easy
1,"As I sat and watched this movie I first thought of having first seen Manon of the Spring but it didn't take long for me to get entirely wrapped up in the storyline of the haunchback and all of his misfortunes wrought at the hands of his wicked, jealous neighbors.When you watch this movie you'll spot people in your own life who play the part of the covetous next door neighbors. You may even see stories in your own life play out concurrently while you watch this story.The French certainly do know how to tell a story. I like how they take their time to let the details of the story unfold and don't rush too much or skip entirely over interesting details. This movie is a must have for any foreign film buffs."
1,Stephan Sulke is one of Germanys songwriters and story tellers. Unless you understand the german language you will not have the privilege to enjoy his music and lyrics to the fullest. The songs on this album are truely some of his best. Comming out of the artists heart and life the storys behind the songs have a bitter humor. i can only recomend this cd.
0,"For a fan of the old wood and fabric fighters of WWI, this film causes nothing but heartburn. The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had. Forget about this film, and just read ""Winged Victory"" for the story by somebody who lived it. If you want to see the real airplanes fly, go to Rhinebeck, NY."
0,"While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology. If you don't subscribe to such beliefs, like me, you find yourself unable to care about the plot or see it as worth your effort to understand. All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock. It felt like I was watching the Catholic equivalent of the cheesy Protestant _Left Behind_ series."
1,"Pampers is awesome, my baby girl has never had a rash since day 1 and she is almost 7 months now. This baby-dry theme is also very true because it holds a lot with out giving her any redness. Also, since its now flexible on the legs, its even much better for my baby girl to move around with it. In addition, I do highly recommend to subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program. I don't have to worry about carrying a big box of pampers at the store, especially all the room it took on my grocey cart!! and at the same time watching my daughter. Now I get it delivered to my door, monthly, with free shipping and at a great price, ..WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR?? I highly recommend this service and PAMPERS... its the best!"
1,"I've been a fan of these guys since the days of the original Locals demo (five tracks with the cartoon cover). I bought the original version of this CD over a year ago at the release show. Great pop-punk. Catchy, fun, not whiny. I don't understand why ""Superman"" isn't on this, but I can live with its absense (I've got two other versions of it). It's awesome to hear ""More Than Local Boys"" with quality production. Why are you still reading this? BUY THE CD!!!"
1,this novel is of course set in england in the eighteeth centuryher a young woman jailed for crimes she commted outside themarriage was branded with a scarlett letter over her bossom.this was tipical of the ear and time.
1,"The reviewer who put down Robillard's playing on this has got to have his head up his you know what! Duke Robillard really demonstrates his swing chops on this one - Duke is a master of many styles including blues in the style of the likes of T-Bone Walker, Albert Collins, Magic Sam, you name it - and jazz in the style of Charlie Christian - He has a very hard hitting swinging style and he comes up with interesting musical ideas in each of his solos. Herb, of course, is a terrefic soft-spoken jazz guitarist. Like Jim Hall he always has subtle tricks up his sleeve. This is by no means a perfect cd - but my rage at the other review has pushed it from a 4 to a 5. It is a fun listen!"
1,Have read this book at least 3 times. This edition is excellent if you have good eyesight. The print is very small and not very dark. I read it under a very bright light and it was fine. It would be good for a student. Good to read on a train on the way to work because it is so lightweight.
0,I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring.
0,"I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Sorry, you won't get results like that. This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability."
1,"I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
0,I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise. Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing. Disappointing...
1,The shoes are great-looking and even though they don't look very comfortable they actually are pretty comfortable after breaking them in.
1,Whoa! This movie literally took my breath away. Its fast paced the whole time never letting up. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing. Forget the VHS get the DVD its cheaper and has extra scenes and interviews. The plot is like nothing ive ever seen before. Buy this and you won't regret it.
1,"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."
1,this game is real fun. it really knows what your thinking and has an attitude that makes you want to out do him
0,"How can I rate something that I did not receive. Yes, I did order Michael Omartian, but received Randy Waldman....and to my surprise, I do enjoy it.....soothing, mesmerising....totally enjoyable. In other words it has become an enjoyable mistake. I hate it and have given it one star, because it is not what I wanted."
1,"It's rare for a sophomore release to surpass an artist's debut; but this is one album that seems to have done just that. I loved Cyndi's debut, but this album exceeded my expectations, which we all know is rare with most sophomore releases. Although she's Australian, Cyndi has a deep, rich, bluesy voice, that sounds like she grew up in the backwoods of the deep South. This is the quintessential of stripped down, bluesy, country roots music."
1,"Sodom Came, they went.I had listened to 'Masquerade In Blood' and 'Till Death Do Us Unite' and I knew the war that was Sodom was over, the ceasefires had been signed. When you end an album with a song called ""Hey Hey Rock 'n' Roll Star"" after putting out crap that just screams ""We wanna be punk and are failing miserably at it!"" I knew it was over. Saddened, I went to survey the damage.And That's when I heard the Air Raid Sirens.Code Red is the comeback album of all time. Sodom has snapped back into place, I don't know why, but they're rocking harder and heavier than they ever have. This is not for ""Limp Bizkit"" fans, you get your ears and a greater part of your head ripped off and handed to you. And that's the way it should be.Notable Tracks are Liquidation, The Vice of Killing, Code Red, and Addicted to Abstinance."
0,"im usually a fan of sony walkmans,,,this one had the potential for greatness,but the design is sooo flawed, that the clip often comes off, sending the walkman flying and the batteries fly out. often times, when i pull the walkman out of my bag, the battery case has opened, and the batteries are out of the walkman, forcing me to reset my 10 preset stations. might seem trivial, but having had to reset the 10 stations probably 50 times in the few months ive owne the walkman, gets really annoying. good news is--given as many times as the clip has come undone sending the walkman flying--it takes a licking and keeps on ticking"
1,Im a huge Smallville fan ever since the first season although I think the season is good and has a good story I miss some of the older characters. But other than that worth the money!!
0,Not all that great! The first section was informative while the rest was a wASTE OF TIME UNLESS YOUR A VEGITARIAN
0,This story has way too much profanity. It is difficult to get past the use of the words to realize the meaning of the book.
1,"Economics in One Lesson is another great ""must read"" book. Like Bastiat's ""The Law,"" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful."
1,This film is thoroughly entertaining and full of laughs. Cher is fantastic as well as Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast. Very funny and sensitive as well. Brooklyn at it's best! Loved it.
0,"The hems on the flat sheet became unraveled after the very first wash, not just in a few places, but the full length on both sides! However the fabric is soft to the touch and the price was insanely low, so I gave it a courtesy second star."
0,"Elton John had peaked as a songwriter in the mid 70's and was even able to tweak out a decent hit every now and then throughout the 80's and early 90's. Today, Elton John's music has become about as exciting to listen to as a trip to the shopping mall. His songwriting has become so formulistic and predictable that you can see him doing the Lion King Part X in about 20 years in a full blown Vegas style show. Elton is a legend whose status is much owed to the music he created more than 20 years ago. Today, it seems comical that this legend has become a comical parody of the ""I think I can still write a hit"" composer who seems to have an endless supply of the same 'adult(now Diseny)-contemporary' melodies with variations on a theme of schmaltz."
1,a few things:1. the beatles are my favorite band ever.2. this does not sound like the beatles. people who say it mimics them or trys to imitate them are just lazy reviewers. noel does steal his fair share past brit rockers though.3.it's up there for me with van halen I and appetite with destruction as the best debut's ever. it's just pure rock n' roll with great vocals and loud guitars.4. this is oasis' best album. the vocals are better in morning glory and the songs are more mainstream but this one is jamming.

0,"I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch."
0,"Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker."
1,"This little book is so much fun. It was written in 1954 so half of the fun is looking at salaries and other data from that time. Huff points out with goofy pictures but sound logic how you can be hoodwinked by the use and abuse of ""averages"" and a number of other ways that statistics are quoted. I use it to make sure that in my work I'm not fooling myself or misinterpreting numbers and charts."
0,"The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates."
0,"I tried to save a buck and get the baby dry instead of my usual swaddlers.....Big mistake, I have ruined a bunch of outfits because #2 rides up the back of these.Penny wise pound foolish, spend the extra few bucks and get the swaddlers."
1,I purchased this book when I got a divorce. I knew it would be hard on my 5 year old and I wanted to give her as much support as I possibly could. This book was amazing in helping my daughter work thru issues. I am happy to say that she is fairly well adjusted and give this book partial credit. She is now 8 and this books still sits on her bookshelf for whenever she may need it.
0,"I went to the dermatologist to get what I was told was a wart, frozen off. It had been there for years so the dermatologist said it might be a tough one to treat, so after freezing it she gave me this wart stick, and told me to apply it every other night and cover it with duct tape. What she didn't tell me, and what was NOT listed on the instructions on the box, was that this stuff needs to be applied exactly to only the wart, because if it gets on any of the surrounding skin, it will burn it off. I can't tell if the product is working because it is just burning off more skin every time I use it and I don't think I'm going to continue using it."
1,"The author paints a story of two unlikely friends, Lenny who is very much like a child but huge and as strong as a bare and often runs into trouble with out knowing it. Bad tempered but somewhat kind George has to get Lenny out of trouble sometimes losing his job. They both share a dream together of having their own farm and just when it seems close to coming true things go absolutely wrong. I read this book and it left me breathless at the end and touched me deeply because of how it reflected the harsh times then and now and of how society deals with different minded people. The writing is beautiful filled with heavy metaphors. I think if you've read John Steinbeck's ""Grapes of Wrath"" you should read this too, or if you are interested in something heavy and thought provoking or if you want to read a good book that's bin banned before :)"
0,Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.
1,"We tried Luvs, Huggies, and Pampers Swaddlers and we consistently had leaks during nap time as our little guy is a champion when it comes to making water. These baby dry diapers have cut down the leaks from several a day to maybe one every 3 or 4 days. Needless to say, we like them a lot!"
1,"Okay, let's face it, it's all about time and there's just too little of it. With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks. I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch? Statistics prove that fewer people cook from scratch and get bland, pedestrian fast food, with Semi Homemade Cooking anyone can be a ten minute maestro of the kitchen."
0,The information was presented in simple language for the non-statistician. It was helpful to consider how statistics are presented and how they can be interpreted. The examples were outdated.
1,This was the first David Lindsey book I read and after this one I went on to read many more. This one remains my favorite and it stays in my mind as few books do. It's an absolutely outstanding mystery. You won't forget it. You can't forget it!
0,"I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best."""
0,product was as described except picture was entirely different. One large lady but in the middle not many. I would have preferred as pictured but not worth returning was will serve as bib just the same.
0,"Super Stupid horror movie that has really only one good performance in the entire film and that belogs to Rachel Weisz, who really does do much for this crap heap while Keanu makes a fool out of himself and the rest of the actors make Keanu look like an proffestional actor.The one star goes to Rachel Weisz only."

1,I cant wait to get this movie on Blu Ray..I already own the first 2 but its gonna be worth seeing them on Blu Ray in HD!!
0,"Half the book (literally) is quotes. The rest, a bunch of touchy-feely, quite unmitigated flapdoodle. In my opinion, anyways. Considering how easily and cheaply quotation dictionaries can be had these days, I'd say, go to the source <g>, and just get one."
1,"Though it can be a bit of a drag at times, this excellent autobiography is threaded with the best of humour (though probably unintended by it's author). 'Tis marvelous."
0,"Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
0,"We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling."
0,"Terribly misleading picture. The Black writing on yellow plastic is exactly what I was looking for, and it is exactly the way most Swanson tools are made. NOT THIS ONE. This is all yellow without a hint of a shadow for contrast. You can still use it for square cuts and such, but don't count on reading the numbers. Get the metal version that is all grey - they are easier to read even with their lack of contrast.I plan to keep the one I ordered and spray paint it black and then quickly wipe the paint off of the flat surfaces in the hopes of getting something like what is pictured. Shame on Amazon for using this picture."
1,"I purchased this for my husband to load a recertification course on and study. He also has music on it and is enjoying it very much. It was a great price, especially for this much memory. And Amazon's service was great as usual."
1,I like using it. Only complaint is the straps to synch your bike are way too long and get in the way
0,"This book was very disappointing, by the title you would think that this book has useful information about the different religions and how homosexuality plays a part in that religion. I could only force myself to read half of this book before I got sick of the author constantly talking about homosexuality as humiliating and ridiculous. Having researched Native American tradition and Wicca I have come to know that neither of these traditions look down on homosexuality as being humiliation or ridiculous. This book is not at all what it appears to be."
0,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
0,"Wow. Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever."
1,"The Story of Macondo and the Buendia family. What a wonderful story full of imagination, sorrow, laughter, solitude, and reality in the same time. How the wars changed the mentality of people, change their behavior, traditions, and it makes them lose the respect for any human relation. How the founded city went from being the most simple, and peaceful place, to this horrifying, deserted city that the technologies ran through it, and its own people stopped caring about what's best for it.How being solitary was the response to many answers, how the Buendia men acted to their defeats, to their pleasures, and how far did they go in order to explore what was out there.The story could be slow at times, but the end has its own unique twist that shows how important history is, and how sad it is when we waste time not doing what we always dreamt of.Such a classic worth reading by Marquez, what dreams, deaths, madness, war, and what pressure has this life on us."
1,"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. ""Open"" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."
1,This box set is a must for people that love Toby Keith's old school music.It's got his first three albums.This is back when Toby Keith had some REALLY good songs out.I'm not much into his newer stuff at all.It sounds nothing like this.Buy this if you're a fan of his earlier music like I am.
0,"The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!"
0,"Lowbrow and pretty stupid horror movie that lacks screenplay to not only explains what is going on but a lead actor who can act. Keanu Reeves is the gapping hole that sinks this ship and his performance will be remembered as one of the worse performances ever in a major motion picture. It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess. If you want to save your dignity and your eyes, skip this film."
1,"What an incredible collection of the Thin Man series. A total of six movies and a seventh was a bonus about the two stars, William Powell and Myra Loy. This was a gift and we were able to watch three of the movies before our house guest left after the holidays. I was sad to see the gift go, ha ha. No seriously, I highly recommend this set of The Thin Man series.."
0,"I don't know what they used for a test truck, but it would not fit on mine. I followed the installation instructions and it just wasn't working out. I am a heavy DIY'er and have replaced many exhaust systems in my time. Dynomax needs to retest this system on my truck. The left tailpipe that crosses over from the muffler kept hitting the OEM muffler heat shield. The right side wasn't much better.Also I could not locate the tailpipe hanger holes in the frame as Dynomax install instructions said they supposed to be. After fighting with it for a while trying to make it work one way or another. I removed it and put it back into the box and sent it back.I have installed a few Dynomax systems on various vehicles with no problems at all. This one just didn't cut it.I purchased a Flowmaster single exhaust pipe system and installation was a piece of cake.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DYNOMAX #17313 FOR YOUR TRUCK.AMAZON'S return policy on this item is excellent."

Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
1,"For the first time in my life, I have listened to a CD all the way through (multiple times!) and loved EVERY SINGLE SONG. The album? Clay Aiken's ""Measure of a Man.""Some critics bash Clay for not singing the typical pop song about sex and drugs (although I have to disagree with the sex part... ""Touch"" is pretty hot :D), but honestly, what's so wrong with having MORALS? I think it's awesome and admirable. Everyone can respect Clay for this album, and he really IS making a revolution in the music industry.For the record, I'm 18 years old; I'm a member of that Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera generation. Haha.I highly recommend this album to EVERYONE, Clay fans and Clay hatahs alike. :) It's uplifting and beautiful... very inspiring, emotional, and passionate.HOORAY FOR CLAY!"

0,I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature.

0,"This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
1,"I have mixed feelings about this product. Before buying this product, I went online and read several posts that said that they had issues with the product being too tight. Surprisingly, I find this product slightly big, even though I bought the right size. This might be related to the garment not feeling tight enough, but I also measured myself before and after I put in the garment and found that I did NOT lose inches. As a matter of fact, I was the same even after I hooked myself up on the smallest setting. But maybe that's because the material of this garment is a bit on the thick side? Not sure. Anyways, I think I'm going to send it back for the smaller size and see what happens. It does flatten my rolls of fat though..."
1,The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise.
0,Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
0,What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
0,"I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book."

0,"Also known as Trinity Rides Again/ La Collina degli stivali.The print of this 1969 Italian western film is very poor. Grainy and greenish sometimes. Right away you will notice that Terence Hill and Lionel Stander (A Star Is Born [1937], Hart To Hart tv series [1979-84], Hart To Hart tv-movies [1993-96] ) have their voices dubbed by someone else. Sometimes you hear Stander's real voice. Stander plays a circus ringmaster. With his assistance he will help Terence and Bud Spencer take down the bad guys in the west. Difficult film to enjoy without Terence Hill's real voice. Victor Buono also in the film."
0,"The printer arrived in a box hardly big enough to contain it. Thin cardboard, very thin styrofoam and the printer didn't print. I contacted the seller. The seller sent a ""new"" cartridge. Still didn't print. The seller then had me send that printer back and sent another printer.It took a good two months to get the second printer which I have never bothered to open because it is futile.Instead, I used the cartridge they sent in my other HP that is the same model. Normally, one of those 12 A Cartridges lasts me a year of hard use. This one stopped working today!!!! I have not used it for even a month!!! These cartridges cost $86.00! This was the biggest ripoff I have ever experienced!Do not, do not fall into the same trap I did."

0,"Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine"

The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them....Say What???!!!! I fired off an email to Creative asking them to provide a little more clarity on this statement with no response. Needless to say I am returning the unit."
1,"It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."
1,"I've listened to this CD over and over and it gets better every time. My favorites keep changing every day. Today I woke up humming ""Perfect Day"". Yesterday, it was ""The Way"". My tastes in music cover a wide range and I don't expect Clay to cover them all. So if you only like hip-hop, rap or hard rock you won't like it. But if you like listening to a beautiful passionate voice sing love songs, pop ballads and light rock this is a must buy."

1,"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."

0,"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."

1,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
0,"Unlike Adams' other works, this provides no satire, and very very little humor. The entire purpose of the book is to identify cities and towns whose names do not obviously make sense, redefine the name as a noun and bestow upon it a nonsensical definition. The only reason I didn't rate it a one or half star, is because it wasn't offensive, aside from the $8 lost."
1,The product was damaged when received so I returned it. Received a phone call asking the problem and had a replacement within a few days. Appreciate the response.

1,"Stacie Orrico is the best. Honestly, I downloaded all of her songs on Napster and I loved it. I loved the cd so much, I decided to buy the cd and support her so She will bring out new albums. Family Christian review says She is Destiney's Child with a Christian theme. I personally think along the lines of Aguilera with a Christian Theme. I am always glad to see young teen artist take a stand for Christ. Some of my favorite songs of hers are Don't Look at me, Stay True, and Dear Friend. I find myself putting their songs on repeat alot. If you want peak at her cd, goto http://www.launch.com/music/artistpage/1,4391,1048259,00.html(vocals included) or http://www.stacieorrico.com/ (just music, no vocals). And Rememeber, If your looking for perfection, don't look at (wo)men, Look at Him."
1,"I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."

0,"Trust me, this film is not worth your time.In the first Robocop the violence was extreme and had a wickedly dark twist to it. Even in the second film there was at least some excellent action sequences. The third film, however, is just Hollywood cashing in on a successful series!The plot is both simple and see through and the characters lack any real depth. Where before RoboCop was a lone ranger style character, who we feel sorry for due to his situation, he is now merely just another comic book hero.A lesson in how to ruin a good action/adventure film concept."

1,"This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there."
0,"I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
1,"This is a very well done dramatization of the game...not that the series only encompasses the first of the three games, however it does so faithfully...they even manage to get in most of even the most unbelievable special attacks in a fun scene...I highly recommend this set for fans and newbies alike..."
0,"Shameful attempt at a hybrid of horror, action and suspends that cast Keanu Reeves as occult detective John Constantine in an adaptation of the vertigo comic book that loses it's edge and goes for the gusto in flat out stupidly with a boring acting turn by Keanu Reeves who just does not come across well in the role. The story just makes no sense at all and feels like it needed a good rewrite for everything to truly come together and the direction just does help move things along. Other than the great scene in which Rachel Weisz get torn out of a building, most of the special effects are not very good and could have been improved during post production. As for the rest of the actors, only Rachel Weisz manages to give a compelling performance despite the bad script in which she had to work with and Peter Stormare does a great five minute walk on as prince of darkness. Nether of them however can save this runaway train that should have been checked before it left the tracks."
0,"This film is nothing more that a cheap horror film. It's premise, using computer software to control ones mind is a weak plot line which, considering it is the central theme, could have been presented in a fashion that might have been semi-believeable. I don't know which would be worse, being controlled by the games in the movie, or having to sit through it."
1,"This was a wonderful book where the main character, Winston Smith is compelled to speak out aganist Big Brother and the end result is exactly what any one of us would have done. A lot of people I know hated the ending, but I think the ending makes the book. It shows the way that we as humans really do respond in situations like that. Absolutley incredible. This is one of the best books I have ever read."
1,"The best thing about this book is that it quotes extensively and piquantly from the writings and speeches of Jack Welch. The intriguing list of ""29 leadership secrets"" (which could have been reduced to ten) is more selective than secret, given that Welch has been preaching them loudly from a very prominent platform for more than 20 years. However, the book will be valuable to Welch neophytes and to fans who want more Jack, or the essence of Jack. Author Robert Slater assumes a certain familiarity with GE's history and initiatives, and sometimes refers to them without explanation. Welch long ago transcended management to become sort of a leadership prophet, and his utterances are sometimes paradoxical, if not contradictory. He says nurture people, but downsize; he says cut bureaucracy, but implement a paperwork intensive Six Sigma program. We promise that somewhere in here, you'll find a managerial principle to fit almost any occasion. What more can you ask of a handbook?"
0,"Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie."
0,"I bought this because my wife had surgery and needed something to use in the shower to reach parts she couldn't bend to get to. The brush cannot handle water very well. It started to get funky and peel and became useless within a month. I guess if one completely dries it off after every use and hangs it in the open air to continue drying, it might last longer and be useful. If you hang it in your shower, though, it turns into some germ ridden piece of junk in no time."
0,"I don't understand why the editors needed to cut the best songs from the show. I also don't understand why the felt the need to change the camera angle EVERY FIVE SECONDS. This makes for a decent cd, watching the video is hazardous to your brain. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL."
0,"this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word ""ramify""? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."

1,"I have always had trouble finding the perfect toner for my skin type. I have oily skin but it is also extremely sensitve to burning and tingly toners that contain alcohol in the ingredients. I have tried a lot of toners, and this is truly one of the best ones I have ever used IMO. It is very gentle and does not produce a burning or tingly sensation after application. It has a great, light, clean scent and does an effective job of wiping away any remaining oils/dirt on your face. I like to use it after cleansing and prior to any day/night moisturizers."

1,"For all of us who feel stupid buying a britney spears CD, or get tired of 16 year old bands who only know one chord sing of their teen angst, FEZ is the savation! The musicianship is superb, the songs are great (including a wickedly dangerous version of the surf classic PIPELINE)and the whole cd just flat out rocks beginning to end! The title track ""WORLD DOMINATION ON $3 A DAY"" is a musical blitzkreig that leaves you gasping for air. Duck and cover, 'cause you've never head anything like it!KREWE OF FEZ takes you to a disco Mardi Gras parade and the only way Thunder Swing won't haveyour toes tappin is if you are a corpse! I'm sure BEACHBALL is going to be the new theme song to some nick at nite show, (And we can only hope TV really gets that cool!) and MONKEYBOY STROLL and YOU KEEP TELLING ME are both instantlate night classics! There's not a weak song on the album! Here's to FEZ!!! This album is AWESOME!"
0,So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.
0,"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."
0,This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it. The love affair was discusting and the torture and Winston's viens were discusting and horrifying..Thats it
0,"I love this opera and I want to use it for my English classes here in South Korea. I ordered the DVD of the historic 1955 telecast. Of course, I knew it was B & W. What I didn't know was the sound wasn't clear and many of the lyrics indistinguishable. Sometimes the music was too loud. The limitations of the stage, after viewing so many natural settings on TV of the past 60+ made many things stilted. I suppose that I should have expected these ""problems"". Nevertheless, I suggest that you re-master this production and give it the visual and audio clarity it deserves.Thank you!"
0,"I loved the first chapter of ""Surrender.."" and then the author killed off the most interesting character... But even worse, there are huge psychological flaws here... Flat characters.. Unrealistic portrait of a mother's grief .. and an ending that is so out of touch with the mother's reality.. It's just too light and doesn't , as so many books seem not to, deliver on its initial promise... Yet, on the positive side, the scenes are vivid, memorable and ditto some of the characters.. But that beginning was SO promising.. that the rest drops you into sadness.. not about the death portrayed but about the value of a great story that doesn't begin to meet its promise."

0,"Well folks, I will not deal with the story. That is not what irritates me. First, the three disk set has two ""bland"" labeled DVDs. The third one looks like the play disk, but is a disk for Ipod or MS Media disk player. To make things more difficult, Disney wants some kind of input code number as if you were loading softwarwe. In my case the thing didn't work.Also, I am sooo sick and tired of Disney putting a ton of movies on DVD for sale at the beginning of their disks. Sure, it only takes about 8 clicks of the remote to get by them, but why should we have to do more than one click.I thought it was about time someone mentions these points."
1,"I first heard Depeche Mode when Violator came out and decided to buy previous albums. This one, by far, is one of the best! 101 is another great album. Strangelove, Little 15, I want you know are all awesome songs! I can hear any Depeche Mode song and go back to my high school years! I was totally in love with David!"
1,Where to start I have had this for 10 years and it is still ticking that alone is a tesament to how well the thing works. Over that ten years It has traveled with me to over a third of the world. This is to include half a tour in Iraq. It has been dropped and has been trough airport security more times than most people. Because of this I have never had a reason to buy an Ipod. And to be honest for music I would rather use this. Only reason that I own anything like an Ipod is that its my Iphone. So I think that the Xtra is by far the one of the best mp3 player made.
0,"I bought the book to help me understand someone who I feel has anger problems. After about two chapters, I determined it would not help me but decided to keep reading, hoping it would get better. For me, the book posed many causes of anger, but never did propose specific solutions. A lot of theories with no substance. I quit at page 178. I was able to tolerate the abundance of religious context, but when Dr. Carter put forth the proposition that criminal behavior is the result of environment rather than free choice, I closed the book forever."
1,"My two boys, ages 5 and 2, are big fans of Ralph Covert and his music. We enjoyed Ralph's 1st CD and are wild about his 2nd CD. We play both CDs all the time and the entire family sings along to all the tunes. This CD is a great buy!! Pick up Ralph's first CD, too, if you don't already own it. No music loving family should be without Ralph's music!!"
1,"Simply a Masterpiece album, THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS A MUSICAL GENIUS. HE PUTS ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL ON THIS CLASSIC.

0,"This book has some excellent reviews. As a student that has studied a few other languages, including OOP languages, I felt that this was the least helpful of all starting books that I've picked up. The code examples do not give you any inkling of how a real Java program may be used. The features of the Java language are introduced without explaining why they are needed and how they are actually used in real programs. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would like a clear example of the Java language."
1,Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves

1,"The matches rock, no doubt about it. I have seen them live and they are my favorite local band ever. I saw them a little more than a year ago for the first time and I called a few friends and told them that this band weas going to be huge someday. At the time I copmpared them to sum 41 and said they were even better than them and to look out for them. Well check it out, here they are on epitaph and i am so proud of them. Only problem is, superman is not on this cd and it is one of my favorites and the fave of many others. that is too bad. all in all, be sure to grab this cd. you will really like it."
0,"This was the worst of three movies, because of how they messed with the violence, and made the movie PG-13. What made the first two movies good was the great gore that made them feel more realistic then what was presernted here. Here there is no gore, but very little action scenes with almost no physical violence at all. This was the worst mistake that Orion made, because as a result this movie flopped with just 10 million at the box office after being shelved for two years, and took down the entire studio with it. Peter Weller should've been in this movie, because it would've been alot better movie. Some people say that this movie is better than Robocop 2, because it has less violence, and focuses more on the story which is true as it does so, but overall this movie is nothing more than a major disappointment."
0,This cd is hurrendous. Ruben is SO much better. Want a good cd - check out soulful.
1,"We ordered from Airsplat via Amazon on January 19th. My son wanted the gun for his birthday party. So, I pai the extra $8.99 for the ""expedited shipping"" cost for 1-3 business day delivery.

0,"I purchased this toolkit from Amazon along with a very high quality Wiha nut driver set (26592). As others have stated, the nut driver is not reversible. It looks to me like the single nut driver is designed to fit both a 2.2 hex nut and a 2.2 - 2.5 star hex nut.However, the Phillips screwdriver is a size 0, and the Costco reading glasses I have that have screws takes a #1 Phillips head screwdriver. The one in this kit is too small.In addition, the Costco reading glasses that I have which have a nut (Design Optics Slim Elite), use a 3.0 mm nut.Don't purchase this for Costco reading glasses.I gave the product a single star because of the misleading description which implies two nut drivers. The single, combo nut driver looks very roughly made compared to the Wiha tools."

1,"Had a basic B&D cooker before, this is one step up from that IMO. The size is nice to have more leftover rice for the next dinner. It is easy to clean but the switch sometimes doesn't work and twice the rice wasn't cooking, just on warm. So now I just double check 5-10 min after. Works well for brown rice."
0,I was expecting to get some pointers for developing skills in c/country skiing. There was no verbal instruction ...only an hour long video showing a man skiing. I shared this video with another cross-country skier who also felt this video had no merit for someone wanting to learn skills. I want a video that gives instructional tips.
1,"Great audio and video with many hits. Only gripe would be that they turned up the audience clapping very loudly after each song and a little too loudly during the songs. This is only a small criticism, however. Buy this DVD."
1,"Don't be too critical of this flick. I've recently discovered Randal Malone to be quite entertaining, if not over the top at times, and consistent with making the rounds in B Horror; and he was creepy in this one. Yes, dimbulb college morons get killed off in this (like about five thousand other slasher flicks) and some can act and some are just eye candy like in Hell Night, Halloween, Friday the 13th and a Nightmare on Elm Street. This one leans more toward Prom Night (1980) or Deadly Lessons, though, with its level of gore and characterizations. It IS shot on video (a high def camera, I believe, if the crisp image is any indication) but as any horrorhound knows this isn't necessarily a bad thing (The Ripper from 1985 remains the low bar here). There is no new ground here (sorry Saw fans) and victims die because they're stupid. This is a fair little film and I keep hearing Randal Malone ask, ""Why are you here?"" in that distant, myopic voice that reminds me of Vinent Price."

1,"I found this book extremely helpful in identifying ways to help my gifted twins, one of whom is a traditional learner and the other is not. The book has great insight and information, plus plenty of real-world examples of how parents deal with issues unique to gifted children. One puzzling thing, though, was the notion that there's an anti-gifted bias and that parents of gifted children are somehow seen by educators as meddlers or pushy parents. The author also seems to have the idea that public schools don't know how to deal with gifted children. That hasn't been my experience so far (our public school has an excellent GT & HGT program) and don't expect it to be as my children get older."
0,"If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time."
1,"Wonderful writing, slow and steady and relentless as a long walk on a hot day on a dusty road in the deep south. Tragic central story of a proud black man who has tried to live as just Man, not black man, and suffers for it when he is wrongfully accused of murdering a white woman, a woman who for many years was his lover. The further you read, the more certain you are that this cannot end well - but no way can you stop reading.Classic Faulkner at his best, with the typical huge cast of 'characters' (in every sense of the word) and side plots."

1,"This Reader's Digest Reissue of M. Millar's ""Stranger.."" is long overdue. Most interestingly, the author is very similar to her late husband, the better known Ross MacDonald (Ken Millar) in exploring hidden family secrets, without the hard-boiled detective (usually Lew Archer) that made her husband famous. But Mrs. Millar is expert at depicting all social classes, including Mexian immigrants, and their family interests, and has a sly humor that keeps this book amusing thruout. Possibly the book drags a bit, but still a top drawer family history suspense novel!"

As for the computer, it may require a complete disk wipe and reinstallation. God help you if you have RAID or something else. WHAT A MESS. Sony is big enough that they don't care.

0,"Right from the beginning, with track #1 (""New Life""), I pretty much knew what to expect from the rest of this CD: fluffy, upbeat synth/pop that made me feel like I was ODing on ""sweetness"". Comparing this CD to Depeche Mode's newer, more somber music, I was amazed at how different they sound now compared to twenty or so years ago--and thank god for the change, too. I know I wouldn't be a DM fan if all of their songs had remained like this.The only two decent tracks on ""Speak and Spell"" (or, at least, the two that I didn't outright hate) are #2 (""Puppets""), a medium-tempoed song with a catchy chorus, and #11 (""Just Can't Get Enough""), a high-energy, spunky track. The rest are just too cheesy and silly for me, in particular the two ""pretty boy"" songs: #4 (""Boys Say Go!"") and #6 (""What's Your Name?""). I've honestly heard catchier tunes on my old Nintendo system, i.e., Dr. Mario. Depeche Mode fan or not, you can skip this CD and not feel guilty about it."
0,"As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on."
1,I like being able to read these books since I don't own an Xbox and am not good at playing video games. It's enjoyable to have the story unfold without restarting.
1,"I bought a Suburban that the previous owner had a little too much fun with. The mirror was broken and I needed a replacement. I called the dealership and gave them my vin to get the actual part number. The Left one and Right one are one number off from each other. Make sure you check with the dealer before you buy to get the actual number for the right wire harness... They wanted $450 for the replacement. I went with this one and it works fine. It doesn't have the feel of the factory one, but all of the mechanics work perfect. I recommend buying a pair. They won't match your stock one on the other side if you buy only one. But they look good together. -J"
1,"I read the other reviews for this title & couldn't help noticing something. This product is also available in numerous other languages which are also sold on Amazon.com I found it odd how the same exact product (but for another language) could receive 4 &5 stars - while this one recieved only 1. Strange indeed - so, I had to check it out. The product is excellent, and it does what it says - it get's you ""speaking"" the language. My daughter actually had one of the CD-ROM's contained in this box set - ""Who is Oscar Lake"" and I'm not kidding when I tell you it cost $$! Imagine my surprise when I opned up the package and saw this title inside. How anyone could anyone knock a software title that cost them $$ - but has a value of $$$, is beyond me. Combined in this set are over 3,000 words & phrases - if learning these can't get you speaking a new language, I don't know what can. After looking at other programs I strongly believe that for the money - there isn't a better program around."

1,"There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book."
0,"where to begin, this product takes atleast 10 to 15 minutes to warm up a 4ounce bottle, and anyone with a small infant that is hungry knows this is entirely to long, would not recomment this to new parents at all, I now take a reusable bottle and fill with hot water and use that to warm up bottles"

0,"I was living in England when it first came out and I thought it was pretty fun and catchy and fit in well with my surroundings. But the unimaginative beats, rote guitar solos and Liam's incessant whine started to grate after the while. ""Slide Away"" is still an excellent tune, but the rest...blah."
0,Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap.
0,"THE MOVIE FOR ME STARTED WHEN THEY GOT LOST IN THE CAVE. I KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOU TO KNOW THE CHARCTERS IN THE BEGINNING. THE DIALOGUE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DID KNOW ONE OF THE WOMEN WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH ONE OF HER FRIENDS HUSBAND. I DON'T THINK THE CHARCTERS WERE STRONG ENOUGH. MAYBE THEY NEEDED STRONGER ACTRESSES LIKE SIGOURNY WEAVER, LINDA HAMILTON EVEN ANGELA BASSET. BUT THE MOVIE HAD IT'S MOMENTS. IT'S GOOD TO WATCH, AND IT'S GOOD TO PUT ON WHEN YOU HAVE MOVIE NIGHT WITH FRIENDS. :-)"
1,"The Greatest Generation doesn't recreate the overwhelming experience of WWII as well as War of the Rats or The Triumph & the Glory, or other recent best-selling novels set during WWII, but it is pretty good at what it does--which is recounting in a straight forward fashion some of what that generation endured to win a war that had to be won."
1,"The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler was great! I never thought Drew was funny, but in this movie, she had me cracking up. The movie is basically about a woman who got into a car accident and lost her short term memory, so everyday her loved ones create the day she last remembered, which was also her father's birthday. Adam, a tourist player, comes into the picture and falls for her regardless of whether she remembers him or not. Adam is always funny and that was the reason I rented the movie. The pirate guy with the five kids had me in tears. And the Steroid Son was pretty entertaining too. This was a really funny movie that I thought was going to turn out not-so-good-but-okay-because-of-Adam. I was wrong."
1,"Great historical reference text full of recipes for food (some of which we would now consider very odd), ways to clean things, sermons on morality, and other tidbits by a woman who was very progressive in her era."
1,Make sure you heat up your drink nicely before you put it on the warmer and your drink stays hot until you finish it.I like it.
1,"This kit actually fits 1993-2001 Jeep Cherokee XJ's, not 93-98 as the description above may say. It's a great basic replacement cat-back kit. It's no Borla, but you're not paying Borla prices either. The only parts that you may need that do not come with the kit are two metric 10mm 1.5 thread pitch bolts - and that is only if you have a 2000-2001 Cherokee. The exhaust sounds great, a little more bass to it, but no drone or rattles. Very easy install, removing the old rusty exhaust is always the hardest part.One other helpful note - if you have to replace any of the exhaust hangers on your Cherokee due to rust (the rear one in particular), they can be hard to find outside of a Jeep dealer. NAPA tends to carry them however."
0,"This US release was supposed to be like the UK release and include a hybrid SACD (Super Audio Compact Disc) as well as the DVD. It does not. The SACD has been replaced by a regular CD. Extremely disappointing ! I'll be purchasing the UK release instead...According to Mute's Head of Catalogue, David Rowntree, Mute commissioned Simon Heyworth's Super Audio Mastering facility to perform the critical re-mastering work for this album. Quote: ""The SA-CD versions take the sound to another level - the next best thing to being there!"". ""If you don't have an SA-CD player, DTS 96/24 is the next best thing.""He doesn't even mention the 44.1 kHz PCM audio of the CD version, which evidently, most of you are listening to.(A digital audio technology which is now 24 years old, by the way. Hey, maybe they will issue the US release on 8-track cartridge too)."

0,"me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD."
1,"This 20 lb. vest is great for doing chores around the house, walking, and working out. It does not have a strong odor, like some other reviews suggested. The one thing that might be a problem is the fit. I'm a 5'5'' female with a small frame. So the vest is slightly bulky. I don't mind because I don't use it to walk out in public, just around the house and at a private gym. Other than that it works great!"
0,Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.
0,"I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"

0,"There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
1,"I bought this DVD to get ready for The Dark Knight. I had forgotten how wonderful and riviting the movie was. Even my 96-year-old mother, who usually leaves the room when I watch any kind of action movie, enjoyed it."
1,"I bought these silk pajamas for my husband for our anniversary, and he LOVED them. They're exactly as described - cool when it's warm out, and warm when it's cool out. He wears them all the time and says they're very comfortable."
0,Arrived fast but the product needed to be calibrated upon arrival. As a matter of fact I've been calibrating this one frequently and it's still lucky to get within 2 degrees of the actual temperature. It just requires too many adjustments and remains too inaccurate. It is big and readable and sticks to the window. Unfortunately this is a case of an inadequate product distributed by a well known name brand.
1,"!Heather's teenage son!All right, all right. What's so bad about this movie? Really. Sure, it's got some crude bits but to me those are some of the funnies parts. And there is nothing wrong with Sandy having one line. She's not that important of a character, anyway. Do you see her often in the show? I do agree that Squidward needed a bit more screentime. I think he's quite funny. I love the TV show, and I loved this movie when I viewed it in the theater on opening night. The ending is most definately the funniest part of this little flick.And for those who think he is homosexual...You've got to be kidding me. He's supposed to be childlike, not homosexual. And what's so bad about homosexuality anyway? I have friends who are homosexuals. So, all of you overly obsessive Christians can go shove it. I'm a Christian, too but it's not right to bash homosexuality or the people that practice it. Sorry for the rant, but things like that do make me a bit mad.PS...Patrick rocks.4 out of 5."

The unit steams stains away, then vacuums up the dirt with the water. Has an adjustable steam control, move from low-intensity to high-intensity for those stubborn messy stains. It was designed by Sharper Image."

0,"I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,"Guthrie covers all of the earlier Platonic dialogues in this volume, up to and including THE REPUBLIC. The next volume in the series (THE LATER PLATO AND THE ACADEMY) covers the rest. Each chapter covers one or two dialogues. Guthrie mentions work published by previous philosophers, and indicates where he agrees and disagrees. The book has a particular emphasis on the development of Plato's theory of the Forms and the influence of the Pythagoreans and Parmenides on Plato's thought. It's very reader-friendly yet packed with information. I can recommend both volumes to casual Plato fans."
0,"I bought this charger for only a couple of bucks and it works like a charm. I don't expect it last forever so i purchased a couple of back-ups just in case. Each one of these Adapters failed after a couple months use, even light use. I would skip this one and seek another way to charge such as an using an inverter and home plug in charger. This year I switched to an iPhone."
1,"This book is important reading for Catholics who take the practice of their Faith seriously. Time and again, during recent years, we have seen purportedly ""Catholic"" authorities, speaking through the media, contradicting beliefs universally taught pre-Vatican II.Has the Church changed so radically? Is what was once wrong, wrong no longer? Does it matter if the formal liturgy of the Mass is changed by the Celebrant? Why?Cecilia Martin documents many abuses, justified by their proponents as ""reform,"" currently assailing the Church. She shows how enemies hijacked the genuine reforms of Vatican II and selectively misinterpreted them to promote an agenda aimed at its destruction. Far fetched? Read the book! It is well written and referenced. Reach your own conclusions. If they are the same as Cecilia's, follow her advice on how to counteract this attack from within."
1,This book is simple to understand even amidst all the details it provides. The explanations are clear and concise while explaining all the jargon and convention. The Vollhardt text also gives a really good background to why reactions occur rather than plopping reactions on the page.
0,"I have used Bragg's Liquid Aminos (BLA) for a couple decades now, but I'm not so sure anymore. I have read the comments at http://www.welikeitraw.com/rawfood/2005/06/bragg_liquid_am.html (if the link is deleted, do a search for Brag Liquid Aminos at the welikeitraw dot com web site). Glutamic Acid and MSG do naturally occur in foods, so their presence is not an indication that the product is harmful. Claims that the soybeans are broken down with hydrochloric acid and then the acid is neutralized with a base substance, like baking soda. However, BLA does not contain much sodium. So, as an experiment, I am laying off the Bragg's for a while and using natural herbal seasonings like powdered cayenne, garlic, onion, kelp, etc., just to see what happens."
0,"Of Mice and Men was an assigned reading in my class. At first I thought it was good (in the first chapter), but then I read on. The book did not suit me. I would not recommend this book to anyone, because I thought it was a bad story. The author's writing style was good, but the plot was stupid. Some of the characters were believable, but others were very inrealistic. The ending was very sad, and you would have never seen it coming."
1,This was the first Brenda Jackson book I've read. I was really into the book the whole time but was greatly disappointed in the ending. It seemed to me as thought the author put a lot of details and drama throughout the book and then such a flat/dry ending. Overall a good read. I do recommend it.
1,"Bought this to add to my ""British Rail Journeys"" collection only to find that it is the same program that was included in British Rail Journeys: Vol, 1. from another distributor which is cheaper and contains two programs.(See my review.) No reason not to buy this but be advised that it is something you may already have."
0,"Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out.*R&J* is simply sensationalist trash. It contains a good portion of Shakespeares worst verse and insipid characterizations. It's unchallenging, crude, and simply melodrama for the most part. It's the Shakespearean equivalent of ""Party of Five"" and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this ""play"" (why not call it a ""B-play?"") is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. ""Hamlet,"" although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is ""Caesar.""And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the ""Bard's"" shadow. Had Marlowe lived, we wouldn't have even known about Shakespeare. And Donne finally been recognized for the genius that he is."
1,"If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)"
0,"I bought this box to store my old sketchbooks in. I was misled by another reviewer who claimed that the box was dust and water-proof, THIS IS FALSE! The cover is cheap plastic that pops into the base by two bulb-shaped hinges. There are large, open gapes between the cover and the base when it's closed, offering absolutely no protection from dust and moisture whatsoever. The handles broke the first time I lifted it (cheap plug-in type connector / hinge). The only thing this box is good for is a trash-can."
1,"This album could have been a 5 stars album if only they had finished every song after 5 minutes of playing. Good songs, but nothing that justifies playing them for 7 or 8 minutes. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3 is because Stand by me is one of the greatest songs by Oasis, a classic. I like the big guitar sound all over the place, with every channel full of guitars. But all around the world playing for 9 mintes and then a reprise for another 2 minutes can only be explained because these guys were hooked on drugs at the time. And Im glad those two left the band, they never had the correct look. They looked like taxi drivers or milkmen to me."
0,"Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep."
0,I think the subject says enough. I'm sure I'd love it if I didn't have to read it for school. I only dislike this book because I have to write an in-class essay for it tommorrow. it's too annoying and i hate the point of view because it's something to be discussed. I'm ure I'd love A Seperate Peace if I didn't have to write an analysis of Finny and Gene's relationship. damn school.
0,"I purchased this book with the idea that it might teach me something new, but I was mistaken. If you already have basic Photoshop knowledge, this may not be the book for you. I returned it because my money would be better invested elsewhere. If you have no idea where to begin with digital artwork, then I would recommend taking a look here. This is for the novice, not the intermediate or advanced user."
0,"This book is the most boring book that I ever read. I mean, all we see is this guy who has a broken leg, and who's trying to solve a mystery that occurs decades ago. What's the point?"
0,"This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
1,I discovered this product a few years ago. Now I can enjoy the Hazelnut flavor without having to brew a whole pot.
1,"You probably know how great it is, but i just wanna give you some tips:1.) Your PC might not support the akward 1400 X 900 res, but you can go online and download PowerStrip and it will add that res to your PC.2.) When playing on an XBOX 360 component, your cross-hairs will have a slight egg shape to them, and everything will appear a little taller than it should. If you don't have OCD, then it shouldn't be a ploblem.3.) Contrast sucks on Component.4.) Thinking about buying a PS3? you can still conect it to this monitor thingy by buying a HDMI to DVI adapter for $30 at monster.Can someone see if you can switch between DVI and VGA if you have them both plugged in?"
1,"Well researched and documented, and yet an interesting and pleasant book to read; I learned from this book many things I completely ignored about history of Nouvelle France. A dispassioned history of the wars among French colonists of Canada, Indians and the British colonists of the early American colonies."
1,"Its very small and much cooler-looking than in the picture. For some reason the picture makes it look big and geeky, but it is actually really small and slick looking. It works wonderfully was a very strong antenna. The only reason it lost a star was because it was expensive for what it is. Although its a good G adapter, its still G. Not N. For double the regular price I would like to get double the speed. However overall its very good."
1,"A hundred years of solitud depicts a bygone era of South America. The uniqueness of this book is the portrayal of ""small town Latin America"". This is a book you should read in Spanish, something is always lost in translation. The frame of mind of Latin America is well described and trasnports the reader into a world, that has been later explored by other Latin American authors.His writing style is widespread and well known worldwide.His ""Novel Prize"" in literature was well deserved."
1,"I REALLY enjoyed this movie. And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back. Uhhh ... DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise."
0,"Let me just say, these are awful. They don't take any hair with them, I've followed all directions properly and tried a whole sheet of them but none of them worked.Don't waste your time or money on this product."
0,"The author seems to be a very juvenile, wet behind the ear young woman who was attempting to publish anything with her name on it. This is definitely NOT a book on ettiquites that I would recommend, it is so basic, so, almost primative!"
1,"The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
0,"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."
1,"I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!"
1,"This book is an indispensable tool for any woman who is facing (or contemplating) a divorce with custody issues and who doesn't know how to even begin the process. It's a ""comfort"" book in the sense that it is precise and reassuring--almost a roadmap to follow-- especially when life seems out of control. This manual is a great resource to share with friends."
0,"Some good action and scenery, but otherwise pretty low budget movie. Only recommended for die-hard horror fans."
0,This trick is terrible. Not what I expected at all. The picture is completely decieving and is not a cup. I would not recommend this at all.
0,"A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess. I cannot even imagine how anyone could get anything useful for his/her trading out this book. I don't have a clew why O'Neill liked this one so much."
1,"Besides being a very talented vocalist, Clay Aiken shows he is versatile and in-tune with today's music. This easy-on-the-ears music will make you get up and dance or reminisce with a smile on your face. I can honestly say there isn't a song I do not like, and this artist will be around for a long time to come."

0,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
0,"I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book."
0,"Although the movie itself is good, this particular version has EXTREMELY poor quality. It was CLEARLY not professionally made. Buyer beware."
1,They came in time. Look fwd for the baby soon! This June will be diaper time for us. The price is very good also.
1,"Still Love in Strange Places takes readers on an exquisite journey to a foreign place (El Salvador) and also deep into the heart of a marriage, into questions of identity and place. Kephart is really asking the questions, To whom do memories and stories belong? and How are cultural legacies passed down to a child. A fascinating book."
0,"The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good."

I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
1,"I had last seen this movie when it came out in 1970. The plot, scenery, acting are as good as it gets. John Mills' performance as Michael earned him a well deserved academy award. He had to spend hours every day just on make-up.As time goes by people pass but their art stays with us forever. Most of the actors in Ryans Daughter are long gone. This movie that was initially not a critical favorite has stood the test of time and is in my top ten along with such movies as Kelly's Heroes, The Graduate and so on. Watching it on VHS format didn't diminish a thing."
1,"In my opinion, Escaflowne has the best soundtrack set of any animated series; all of the Escaflowne soundtracks are amazing and you wouldn't be disappointed if you had only one to choose from. That being said, this one is my personal favorite as it contains what I consider two of the most beautiful songs in the entire series (""Farewell"" and ""Arcadia"") plus a couple of performances from Maaya Sakamoto (whose voice is also divine). If you can get your hands on a copy, I strongly suggest getting this one. And while you're at it, check out other works composed by Yoko Kanno - she's simply amazing."
1,"Really nice stand for the flute - I like the weight and how solid the legs feel. The peg is covered with velvet, so it won't scratch the instrument. The flute does, however, have some wobble as the peg is a bit smaller than the interior of the flute. (If you look at the headjoint, it can move several inches back and forth due to the extra space around the peg.) Although the wobble can be a bit unsettling, I'm still confident in the stand because of the weight/solidity of the base. Would be perfect if the peg were slightly bigger."
1,"I originally read this way back in jr. high and sadly only remember being entranced by it--not recalling any of the plot. I finally got around to the rereading and recalled why I had the original feeling of enchantment. This is one good book.Kit Tyler is a sixteen-year-old girl who leaves Barbados after her grandfather's death for the more austere world of Puritan New England to say with her aunt's family. But Kit is completely unprepared for the ways of these people. Even so, she manages to grow in unimaginable ways as she connects with people with whom she would have never seen herself.And it's not a simple moralistic book. It's a book about a girl coming of age. Unlike other books of the Puritans, there are no villains, just those who are different and it's amazing to see Kit come to understand that.The characters are entrancing and dimensional, the setting is described in an honest prose that only shows Speare's love of New England.It deserves its Newberry."
1,"Personally, I enjoyed the book tremendously. The author dived into the action pretty quickly, and it took me just a few pages to get to the excitement. By the way, I'm reading the unabridged version, so correct me if I'm wrong. I would have preferred more action-packed scenes and adventure in the book cos' on the whole, it was pretty stale........."
0,"Sure enough, I tried to get away cheap, and got bit in the you-know-where for it. Three months after buying it, the card is unusable. The lifetime guarantee? You need the original packaging and receipt. I suppose I can only really blame myself for not saving it all, but hey, it was a well reviewed $20 card, right? So now it's a holiday, with everyplace closed, and I have no flash card. You get what you pay for."
0,"I saw this movie last night and was not too impressed. I'm not going to say it wasn't ""realistic,"" it's not meant to be. I mean, jeez, look at the game! I will say that I wish it had more in common with the game... too much was changed, in my opinion. Luigi is a young guy (with no moustache!), Toad is some kind of hippie, and the Goombas are shrunken-head dinos. I suppose most people would expect things to be more similar to the original, just like they'd expect a movie based on a book to be similar. I also got the impression that the writer/director really wasn't familiar with the game, maybe that's why there were so many changes. In any case, it is always tough to take a story from one media to another, and it seems to me that the efforts more often than not fall short of the mark."
0,Don't waste your money. The only way to make this video a decent workout is to repeat each sequence by yourself during the 2 to 3 minute rest periods which follow each 1 minute of exercise. Terrible. Don't know who gave it five stars. Perhaps the friends of the instructor!

Keith Tenniswood of Two Lone Swordsmen fame demonstrates his solo credibility here with his superb debut album.Combining breaks and beats with smooth, simple melodies, Tenniswood brings all that is good about electro music together.What made the songs on here even better are the beautiful electronic, ambient, pulsating and shimmering walls of sound Tenniswood creates behind his songs. Fans of Two Lone Swordsmen will know what I'm talking about, and Tenniswood uses this skill to great effect on this album.An excellent, consistent electro, breakbeat album, with strong hints of electronica and IDM. One of the best electronic albums of the past few years."
0,"Whoa!! A flying robocop with the strings attached and all. No way man, this one bombs. And where's Peter Weller? The dude IS Robocop!!! Cheesy movies I can handle, but this one's going moldy. Time for Robocop III to catch a wave. See yah!"
1,"If one were ahead of the pack and twenty years later the pack had caught up and stomped all over one's then newly demarked turf, is one to blame and to be scorned as cliched by ""today's standards""? Certainly not.The problem is, sometimes it happens. Hassell, Riley, Reich et al are usually in this situation. Now that their studies of non-Western music have been exploited and rampantly overused by anyone from hip-hoppers to electronica artist as well as avant-garders, their legacy is muddled by nay-sayers and not very knowledgeable folks. A shame indeed.Hence, the music of Hassel in Power Spot and Fourth World Music is what the latter day acolytes should be measured against, not viceversa.That said, the music itself is a thrill to experience for the first time (and well beyond). Its use of microtonics, polyrhythms, etc puts to shame many a contemporary ripper-off, setting a standard that still has to be upped. Pure class!"
0,So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed
1,great water housing. but where is the lens cap? i spent $200 on this housing at a store and i am so paranoid about scratching the lens its rediculous.
0,"It just didn't work. Astounding sets alone can't create on-screen chemistry. The story line and performances were weak, and, even worse, I didn't think it was scary...and wasn't that the whole idea? I left the theatre feeling cheated. This movie was just plain DUMB!"
0,This product was recommended to me by my lactation consultant and was said to be much stronger than drinking the Mother's Milk tea and more effect than using the More Milk Plus capsules. I followed the directions exactly as followed in terms of not drinking fluids 15 minutes before/after taking this and tried it for a over a week. I barely saw any increases in my milk supply at all. Maybe this just didn't work for me.

0,"I've been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've left a comment because I hope that you won't waste your money like I did. I have 2 sons. My baby uses the Swaddlers and my toddler uses Cruisers. When Cruisers was unavailable online, I thought, the Baby Dry can't be that much different, they both are made by Pampers, right? WRONG!! I have been washing wet bed sheets and pjs every single morning for 2 weeks since my toddler used the Baby Dry. It can not hold anything. I had my son pee in a clean Baby Dry standing straight, waited for a minute, then took the diaper off. The pee was dripping out from the diaper. It was the worst diaper we have ever tried. I heard that Pampers changed the Cruisers to be thinner as well. I am giving Huggies a try now. Though it was not as soft as Pampers, I have not need to wash the wet bed sheet or pjs for the past week. Now I have a big box of Baby Dry diapers sitting in my garage that I can't decided if I should donate..."
1,I love this show! I ordered seasons 5 and 6 in July of 2011. Maybe the DVDs will be out in 2013.
0,"HI All,Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it's a wast of time.........leacking after a week. fix that than find another leaking...till u trash it..and get rid of it..i have the pic and i paid for it $60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo."
1,"Living where I do, taking an in-person hooping class just isn't an option, so this was the next best thing. I picked this DVD over the 'HoopGirl' DVD because I'd read elsewhere that there are 'troubleshooting' sections on this DVD that cover what you're probably doing wrong (and how to fix it) if you just aren't getting the move(s).The DVD is well-edited, I can understand the instructor easily (even if my body is sometimes slow to catch on), and the troubleshooting sections are a definite help. My one minor quibble is that the menu could use a little more breaking down (it would be nice if I could choose which section of hip hooping that I wanted to go back to, for example), but I am still giving this DVD 5 stars because of the way the information is presented. I hope to be giving the Level 2 DVD a try in the near future. Can't wait!"
1,"These were cheap and effective, they sound great considering that they are driven by a the original OEM radio/deck. Other speakers for the same price don't compare, and were returned, they can't hold up the bass parts as well as these."
0,"If you enjoyed the ending of Foundation's Edge then you will probably like this book. You will find more analogies comparing Gaia to things in the isolate world, and Bliss squaring off with Trevize about stuff you really don't care about. Asimov does, however, succeed in making you feel the fustration that the characters feel when they don't discover ANYTHING about Earth for the first 450 pages. The most annoying character is Fallom. I found myself wanting Trevize to kill Fallom as he suggests he will do several times in the book. The ""twist"" revealed in the last sentence is all but a surprise as Trevize foreshadows it several times in the book. I just read a review that this was more part of the Robot series than the Foundation series. I had only read the first four Foundation novels so perhaps that is why I didn't care for the portion of the book where they meander through space accomplishing nothing."
0,"Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster."
0,"Received case well packaged and fast shipping! The case itself form fits phone fine, but does not snap well together. The first time I tried one of the top tabs broke. So for temporary purposes until I get a new case I used a dab of Gorilla glue to hold the upper two halves together. Obviously if I have to reset the phone this will be the end of the case. Only 3 bucks, but I would put that money towards a soft silicone case."
1,"If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable."
1,It was a good movie for sci fi people who have already seen the stargate series. came to our house quickly
1,"When I first came across the title of the book. I was rather skeptical, is it possible to apply some of the strategies in battle to investing or is it just another book to ""ride on"" the fame of Sun Tzu.Well, I ended up buying the book and learnt quite alot about investing from reading the book. Curtis writes in a easy-to- read, easy-to-understand style and make investing fun. He also put in actual examples of how he actually used some of these strategies in analysing stocks for investing and his investing track record is shown in his website... So you can actually verify that what he shared can be applied and not just theoretical stuff and he does put his money where his mouth is.For any person interested to learn about investing, other than Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch, this is another book you can consider reading up too!...Cheers!Dennis Ng"
1,"Best primer on stats existing. I've read it several times; my daughter read it at age 13 and both enjoyed and understood it. She's coaching her undergrad friends in college stats now, and even more importantly, analyzes news and thinks critically about it.A well-written, timeless book!"
1,"Assembly was pretty straight forward, and when you're all done with the TV on top ... looks pretty slick. Strap in back secures TV, and cover in front does the same.Due to support beams in back, my receiver had to go right in the middle on the 2nd shelf. Those same beams, could possibly get in the way of wiring on the top shelf if putting components two across. In fact, I need to get a couple of right-angle connectors in my case. There is also a chance since the glass is at an angle on the sides, that one foot of a componenent all the way to either side may not touch the glass. I also wish the top shelf was a little taller for stacking components.Even with these quibbles, I am very happy with the stand, because the quality is very nice, and the end result looks great & feels solid."
1,"I recently started commuting to work via bicycle. The only route I can take is quite busy, so I started out by riding on the sidewalks and nervously dodging all the cars turning right in front of me. The sidewalks were covered in trash and debris, and I had to maneuver around pedestrians too. After reading Effective Cycling, I ride in the street, with more confidence and fewer problems, and I arrive at work much faster. I highly recommend Effective Cycling for anyone who regularly rides his/her bike in an urban setting or wishes to."
0,"Three crucial pages were torn from the book: The ""Introduction by Susan Shillinglaw""(Director of the Steinbeck Research Center); ""Suggestions for Further Reading""; and ""A Note on the Text."" Since I was reading the book for a class discussion, these items would have aided me greatly during the discussion period."
0,"This 52 minute video is nothing more than 8-10 minutes of bad content on a loop. It is a video of one woman doing sing-along style songs. Any claims that this is a ""Sign Language"" video are dubious at best. There are very few real American Sign Language signs, so few as to be pointless. An episode of Blues Clues has more signs. I feel ripped off, and I didn't even pay any money of out my own pocket (I was using $15 in free Amazon Unbox credit from a promotion). Stay away from this video at all costs. I highly recommend Signing Time, which isn't yet available from Amazon Unbox. I hope it will be soon; I'm going to send the makers of Signing Time an email asking them to get their content online."
0,"I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now ""drones"" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind. Still curious as to the outcome as I forgot the ending. More when completed.Would I recommend this book? depends, but not for everyone...I liked reading ""The Help"" better with the character interactions..."
0,"Okay, I did not buy this product. Nor will I. There has to be something wrong with the title of this video. If they mean little sister, then I think the correct pinyin form of it should be mei mei. Mimi means breast in Chinese. Are all the reviewers of this English only speakers, or has someone who actually speaks Chinese seen this video? I'm just curious if their pinyin is incorrect, then will their pronunciation of words be incorrect as well?"

0,"If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward."
1,"I've been buying these diapers since my 1.5 year old was born. I briefly tried Luvs and Huggies and have found that these are so much better, softer, less leakage. Plus it's a great value."
0,Most of the diapers' strap are glued to diaper itself such a way that you cannot use those diapers. I am just throwing away lots of diapers without using it...
1,"This movie is scary. This group of women thinks it is fun to go on annual adventure trips. I prefer a nice hotel on the beach, but creepy crawly caves sound better to them. You really get to know the characters and care about them and the things they have been through. It is their trip to the caves and what they go through there that will terrify you. If you are claustrophobic, you will definitely be freaked out by this movie. I love a good scary movie, which may be why I am an insomniac, and this movie is well written and acted and will give you the creeps. I highly recommend it. Power Path to Love"
0,"I really wanted to like this, but it is just not something I seem to be able to adjust my taste buds to. I had read reviews other omnivores liked it, and it wasn't just for vegans or vegetarians, so thought it would be better than it is. The quality of the product seems fine - even flakes and nice color, but oh, the taste is something that ruins oatmeal or anything else I've tried it in."
0,it only had a hint or a flavor of the book. I actually read the book which is really good if you like freaking yourself out. The movie was nothing like it. The movie was just one of those weird 80s things
1,"The autobiography of Ben Franklin is a worthwhile read simply because of who Ben Franklin is. It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read."
0,"Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
1,If your looking for a great book that addresses the use of lethal force than this is it. A great place to start be it a beginner or old timer this is a must read. David Kenik not only wrote well but put it in a format that is understandable. Well thought out! This is a must have book for anyone who wants to understand what is needed to justify an armed response. It does not replace personal training or what can be learned in a class (interaction). It does however build a great foundation for what is needed to to understand in responding with lethal force. If you own a firearm for personal protection than you need to own this book.
0,"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."
0,"I didn't realize this movie was a comedy when I went to see it, but I did end up laughing through most of it because it was such a piece of garbage!"
0,"I intended to use this TiVo with an AT&T Uverse system....Although it was advertised to work(by TiVo) and I got the model that they recommended...it would only receive one channel and about 20% of the time when it tried to record, it would not be able to effectively change to the correct channel."
0,this book spends too much time on history and stories. beginners need to know how to determine the temperature of the oven. advanced cooks may know how many coals to put on and under but charcoal is better to learn with.twelve chapters of history and differances of cast iron and aluminum is too drawn out. the final blow is when there are only 19 recipes and most do not appeal to me.
1,"The seller of this item ships for free and they are quite fast getting them out the door. I was worried about installation and the column seemed slightly flimsy at first, but assembly was a snap in spite of not reading the directions very careful, and it seems quite sturdy once assembled.The accuracy itself seems to be great. Like all balances, the accuracy is phenomenal. No stepping on and off and getting wildly different results like with most scales I have had.Definitely worth the price if you are serious about watching your weight."
0,I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player.This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard. The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers.I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I don't get chain grease on my trousers.
1,"I have yet to 'feild' test this books info yet, but I couldn't put it down. I read it front to back right away and have been designing/planing while reading. I never thought I'd get so into horticulture. This book has me really excited about growing canibus becaused it's so much more than putting some seeds in some soil and watering it. There is a real science/art to growing WELL and this book seems to cover it all from start to finish and after. There is practical help for those who wish to grow in countries where it's illegal, (sound advice from experianced people who grow and have done so for years). I haven't read any other books on this subject to compare it too but I am very pleased with this book and feel I don't need another with more info. To say there are a few gramarical errors in this book is an understatment, but I see this as a testiment to the quality of what they have grown, (or at least what the editor was smoking)."
1,"I would have to to even come close to what I feel is the best CD out this year. It's not filled with foul language, sexual innuendos, and you can actually understand the lyrics!!! What a concept!!! Clay's voice and emotion come through crystal clear on each and every track. While I've been a Clay fan since his Atlanta audition, I know people who weren't and they have listened to the CD and are now convinced. No matter what perception you may have about Clay, the man can sing!"
0,I rented this poor excuse for a movie and couldn't help falling asleep the whole time. It's pretty predictable and not very entertaining. It's not really worth buying.
0,"I won't go into an elaborate diatribe on just how terrible this product is. To sum it up, it's useless and was not market-ready. TiVo customer service and support is abominable, and the ""help"" they supply for this product is laughable. My son has been a network systems engineer for over 10 years, he had to come and try and get it to work. After a bit of fussing with it, the adapter was getting poor reception. The wireless router and modem are barely 30 feet from the TiVo box, with open space throughout. My laptop easily achieves 12Mbps without a hitch.For a goof, we moved the wireless router and modem to the kitchen table, and hooked it up to the laptop. Only then were we able to get a decent signal, with the wireless router about 8 feet from the TiVo box and network adapter. Several calls to TiVo got me canned, simple fixes to try. It works best when you throw it in the trash."
1,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
0,"Altman has moments. Early in his career, these moments came often: ""M*A*S*H"" and ""The Long Goodbye,"" ""Nashville"" and ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller."" But he also had disasters and disappointments. This lackluster, tedious picture belongs in the latter folder. There is an utter lack of narrative momentum, Carradine and Duvall are a real bore, and the use of radio bits fails to add much. No one needs to see this movie."
1,"My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!"
0,"This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."
0,"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
1,"But when all things are considered the book is not really that bad, in fact certain quotes are very uplifting. I would rather read this then one of the 5 thousand Chicken Soup for the Souls any day of the week."
1,We felt that this book has something to teach to everyone. It talks about two men that try to survive together. Of mice and men is a book that you can't miss beacuase it treats reality so well.

0,This card is completely incompatible with Emachines' Tri-Gem Motherboards. I uninstalled all of my previous video drivers because that is what ATI told me to do when I unsuccessfully installed their card. Their automated Tech Support is useless and their phone support costs [$$$] a minute! I finally talked to Emachines' tech support and they told me that it would never work with my PC. I told them it was a good thing Circuit City has a No-Hassle 14 day return policy. I give this card 1 star because I can't give it any less than that.
1,"this set is big! it's very well made, the pieces are nice, the board is durable. I would recommend this set, especially for the price!"
1,When my girls grew out of their swaddlers we moved on to the babydry and loved them. They fit perfect and have no leaks. I suggest pampers products to everyone I know. It is the only brand that has proved itself over and over to me and I trust on my sensitive kids bums.
1,"I am a HUGE Clay Aiken fan and I am excited to tell all the people around the world that Measure Of A Man by Clay Aiken is an AMAZING CD! MOAM is the ONLY cd where I liked EACH and EVERY song on the CD. Clay Aiken is THE role model 4 all children, teens and young adults out there, I know that he's my role model! :) Buy Clay Aiken's cd!!!!!!!!! This CD is TRULY worth listening to!!!!! I can't wait until Clay comes out with another CD. His voice is amazingly powerful and sounds great! My favourite songs are Measure Of A Man and The Way. All of Clay's songs speaks to you in a different way, and this CD gives personal inspiration to everybody out there. This CD reminds everybody of why they wanted him to win American Idol! But, true role models don't need a title in order to be the best! :) Bye Clay Aiken's Measure Of A Man! It will be the best CD you will ever have! :)"
1,"first of all, the music on zelda ocarina of time matches the setting you are in. for example, listen to the water temple music. most people get an image of a watery or icy place. the game's songs impressed many people im sure. the game is already great by it self, but the music just takes it to the next level."

Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
1,I buy these for my two yr old and they work great. Great price great size great diapers! These diapers are made a little bigger so they fit small and bigger babies.
0,I always read Belva Plain's new books since I have enjoyed her previous books very much. I found this book to be predictable from the onset. I looked at the front of the book twice to be sure I hadn't inadvertently grabbed a Danielle Steele book from the library shelves. The story line is a standard and I found nothing redeeming or unique in any of the characters. I didn't feel any empathy for Hyacinth's situation since it seemed totally unrealistic that she would have relinquished her children without resorting to every possible alternative. I am certain that Belva Plain will return to her previous writing style with her next book(s)...please.
0,"Anyone who objects to making light of rape, including prison rape, should refuse to buy this book. If you're a Christian, ask yourself if laughing at rape is the moral standard you want to uphold. If you're a humanitarian, vote with your dollar and boycott Borowitz' glib joke about rape, even the rape of others who have harmed us."
0,"I almost gave up reading this book after a couple of chapters for the same reasons as the 1-star reviewers. I can't say I care for the writing style. It reminds me of the ""Guy Noir"" skit on ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which is, of course, supposed to be a funny take-off on these kinds of books. The protagonist seemed to be more of a stereotypical formula rather than a real person. I struggled up through Chapter 9. Then I began to get more invested in the story. I think the writing began to improve a bit and the characters gained some dimension. Still, it ends up being 2 stars for me. Perhaps his later books are better?"
1,I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.
1,"This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"
1,"Fascinating look into the past. I think some people might think this book has a few good ways to go green old fashioned if you're interested or off the grid or survival stuff or whatever (Just steer clear of the medical section. Fear Factor anyone?) but I think it is mostly useful as a historical reference. A great insight to logic back then. Still it was still fun to let your imagination run wild dreaming of doing some of these things. Also if you are going to do some reading about history why not go directly to the source on that particular subject? The chapter on raiseing girls was very modern in some suprising ways, I expected a sit down and be quite chapter but thats not what I got. For the price I think it was worth it."
1,"I've been a longtime subscriber to Men's Fitness. As one of the other reviewers said, this magazine used to be better. It still has a great deal of workout, diet and fitness information, but it's not as good as it once was. I think the magazine is losing its focus a bit as each issue does seem to have more and more about sex, pornography, etc.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because a lot of the workout and fitness information is still very useful (otherwise I would give it fewer), but I used to feel this magazine was worthy of 5 stars."
1,"The Air TV series is one of the greatest drama's I have ever seen.To say the character design, art, and story are memorable is an extreme understatement.The inclusion of the OVA episodes makes this an incredible value.As with all things, I strongly recommend watching it in it's original language (Japanese in this case)with English subtitles so that you can experience it the way the director intended.Overall: I strongly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys dramas"
0,"Yes it is truly amazing what the man accomplished andI cannot take anything away from his feat.His book, on the other hand, I was sorry that I bought.After the first 3 chapters I gave up. Barely making itout of the desert. Maybe I'll pick it up at a later datebut I just got tired of ""Day 1: I ran"", ""Day 2: I ran"",""Day 3:I ran, it rained""... yawn.I need a book to convince my wife to hike for more than10 days at a stretch and this fell far short.Not recommended"

1,"I bought this for my father as a gift. He seems to really enjoy it. Being something he had in years past, the hand held infrared devices became a little hard to locate. While this one doesn't seem to have the super high build quality that ones did from years gone by, it does the job and as the gift receiver my father seems to be very satisfied with it."
1,"I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer."
1,"Some sequels do not carry the intensity and glory of their pilot movies. This movie definitely does. The main characters are all back and they are involved in an attempt to restore Narnia to its formal glory. The action is top notched and the story grips you from the beginning. The blu-ray version looks great and the sound is crisp and intense. Although some of the movie is not actually in C.S. Lewis' novel, it still stays true to the story line and fans of the beloved series will love this movie. I can't wait until the third movie release. Bring it on!!!"
1,"I remember reading this when I was young. I found it again on Amazon and bought it to share with my kids. A sci-fi classic! I would recommend this to all kids, young and young-at-heart."
1,"The Halo franchise has always been one to impress me. From the moment I started reading The Flood, I was able to immediately remember the exact scenes described in the book from the video game. There are many nice additions, however. As a fan of the Halo series, I highly recommend the books because they fill in a lot of holes that the campaign of Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo: Reach never address.To the casual reader not particularly involved in the Halo universe, these books are probably not for you."
0,"Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy."
1,"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"
0,"This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
0,"The one I was shipped was junk. It broke the first time I put 25 pounds on it. One of the straps that hangs past the ear tore right off. One of the pictures above shows a guy with two red Olympic plates on the thing. The red plates are 25 Kilos each, that's 110 pounds. Frankly, I wouldn't trust the hardware on this thing with that much weight. It broke in such a way that I can still use mine, and it'll be a good long while before I'm putting 110 pounds on one of these, so I'm going to keep using it. However, if I had it all to do over again I'd trade up for a better one."

1,"Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list. It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format. As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is."
0,Can't say if this is a good product or not but the really got in the way while I was typing on my computer at work. My doctor suggested them for my tremors but they where to uncomfortable for me. You may like them for what you are using them for. Not a negative review this is more a personal choice review.
0,"This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others."
1,"I picked up this book and from there it was on and poppin'. I'd read the reviews after a friend told me about the book and the reviews seemed (for the most part) pretty supportive. I like a good fast book too. With little mouths to feed and job and school, reality is all too much of my life so I needed some good fiction. When All Hell Breaks Loose was it. Even though Adrian wasn't honest and disrespected Greg, I know sisters out there who are foolin' brothers so it wasn't far from a certain truth (no insult to the real lesbians of the world but Adrian was confused, don't act like you don't know). Does anyone know about Cubicles? Will it be a sequel? I agree with the movie idea too. I loved this book! Oh, the language was a bit much, but I gave room for Ms. Spenser being a first time novelist. She'll get better because her story had all the great qualities of a good novel."
0,"David Garnett (1892-1981) was a British writer and publisher who received literary recognition when his novel Lady into Fox was awarded the 1922 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.This particular work is as enigmatic as its writer and this particular reviewer failed to understand the work. The plot is simple enough: Sylvia, the 24-year-old wife of Richard Tebrick, suddenly turns into a fox while they are out walking in the woods. The rest of the story is the tale of Richard dealing with the transformation and his struggle to accept his wife's ego as she slowly loses her humanity to the fox form she inhabits.Is the story a morality play? Fictional essay? Eccentric novella? The last gasp of scandalous English yellow literature? Each reader will have to judge for his or her own."
0,"Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least."
0,"I never read the book, but the CD is such a masterfully ""abridged"" version of the book that it manages to tell you for hour HOW WONDERFUL six sigma is, while totally neglecting to tell you WHAT SIX SIGMA ACTUALLY IS, or HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED. In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it."
0,"Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."
0,"I subscribe to Traditional Home magazine and have purchased their other books. Signature Style was a terrible disappointment. It lacks the interesting, informative style for which they are known. Pictures and text are below par. Gives you the feeling this was done by some other entity who dashed it off without much thought. Save your money."
0,"OK, people, all I have to say is this thing sux. The price may be low, but the thing is just plain crappy. And I though CD players were supposed to play music..."
1,"Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."
0,"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."

0,"aside from the Fact that I was only trying to get the Cut He did with R.kelly""Quit Actin"", I wasn't paying this cat no musical mind.Ray J is vocally tone challenged.he can't make up His Mind who is attempting to jack as a Singer.One Minute He wants some R.kelly,then Usher,Omarion,etc...Problem is dude ain't much of a Singer.so i was surprised to hear any Record Company was actually gonna give Him a solo deal.but anyway I got the song I wanted&tunned out the rest.maybe if He is lucky he can get a gig on the UPN network.wait a minute I heard he got something linned up well stick to it&stay out of the Music lab."
1,"This album is one of Ray J's finest works. It's gritty and it's honest. His vocals are REAL. When you're a true artist you understand that making a song is not always about hitting the 'right note"". It's about the feeling behind the lyrics. The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview"" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience. Overall the album is worth every penny you spend because it sounds nothing like the regular mindless stuff you hear clogging up the airwaves today."
1,Historically based detective story about Richard III's England which is being investigated by a modern day Scotland Yard officer named Grant. The story bounces back and forth between the Grant's `investigation' and visits to the hospital in which Grant is a patient. This is a short story that introduces into the reader to a historical event without making it the overly boring book non-historians are expecting.
0,"Poor quality recording, and though it calls itself ""Trinity Rides Again"" it is not a Trinity movie and lacks the humor and characterizations I was expecting."
1,"This is a really wierd book. In the beginning it starts out like any country in a war, but later it delves deeper. The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show ""Big Brother""), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future. If you like Orwell's books you'll LOVE Animal Farm."
0,"If you're interested in only buying this to listen to the interviews and comments of artists who were there, and finally getting to hear from Rosenman and Roberts, then by all means buy the DVD. But if you're buying it for the musical content you'll be very dissapointed. They edited a lot of the songs horribly and cut the life out of them."
1,"This game is a lot of fun. I love the smart aleck way it talks to me. Sometimes I stump it. Often the challenge is, ""how well did I answer the questions?"" Sometimes I replay the game answering questions differently and the ""toy"" finally gets it right. Fun on many levels. AND...a great gift. I've given 3 so far."
1,many of the names are still out there for resources. would prefer a newer edition for assisting client in our area
1,"It's nice to finally have many of these remixes in one place, including many I had not heard before. Despite these songs being from many different genres and times, they flow together like liquid butter! The new Thievery song ""Originality"" is a slamming reggae jam that will liven up your party in the coming months. Imagine today's young people getting down to The Doors, courtesy of Thievery's ""Strange Days"" remix. Elsewhere, there are plenty of songs to spin, no matter your mood. This is not just some knockoff package till Thievery can deliver another studio album - this is a full fledged musical work!On another note, it's nice to know that Thievery is embracing the beauty of album packaging, with another first rate package here to go along with ""The Cosmic Game"" and ""Richest Man in Babylon."" Even though CD sales are going the way of the passenger pigeon, it's nice to browse through such an elaborate package, which can then enhance the entire listening experience."
1,"Ok, after reading some of the reviews here, I have a few things to get off my chest. To you guys who panned this release because Larry isn't 'shredding' like he did 15 or 20 or 25 years ago - please note that Larry is growing up, you should take notes. If you want crunchy riffs and monstrous dexterity, go see Steve Vai or Joe Satriani. Larry's playing has matured into a warm sound that envelops like a 10 year old Cabernet or the arms of a familiar lover. Guys like Peter White could take a lesson here and there. And the nicest thing is the use of all REAL instruments, no annoying drum machines.With that said I have one beef about this release. Larry, and all other purveyors of 'smooth jazz', please take note: NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS, NO MORE COVERS. It reminds me too much of Muzak, ok? That's why you don't get 5 stars."
0,"The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
1,"Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story's interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch."
1,"Lambasted on it's original release and despite significant flaws, Super Mario Bros. has maintained a longevity which has transcended it's original release, and now is a cult classic"
0,"Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
1,a fascinating and stimulating account that seems to put things into the proper perspective. Makes the myths all the more enjoyable.
0,"I am a fan of Joyce's writing especially Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist, but this is pure garbage. Thank goodness for the look inside features at amazon, so that people will be able to know what to expect when ordering Finnegans Wake. The novel has no plot and lacks the vivid descriptions of seemingly meaningless things that made Joyce's other novels so great. Here, he picks random foreign words and places them wherever he please just to make his book seem original and artistic. The result is an incomprehensible piece of garbage that is not only plotless but devoid of any writing ability and talent.Use the look inside features to see what I'm talking about."
0,"Don't get me wrong.....I am 100% Clay fan....but....this CD was a disappointment. The songs are more teeny-bopper type of songs. ""David Cassidy"" re-visited. His choices of music on American Idol suited him much better. Hopefully his NEXT CD will bring him back to that format."

0,"I wouldn't buy this printer again. I have had it about 2 years. I get paper jams but that's not the worse thing. The ""OK"" button stopped working. So when I get a paper jam, I have to shut the printer off and then back on. Also when I put new print cartridges in, I can't use the OK button so I have the message on the LCD to ""Align the cartridge"".It does print nice pictures.Anyway, I have had several HP printers, they are usually great products. This is the worse printer I have ever had."

0,"I didn't like installing this printer at all. It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy, by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark. The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem, following the directions exactly, it crashed my entire system. It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors. Maybe it's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster. I also don't like the color quality. It reads color much darker than what's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint. I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark."
0,"The time spent on reading this book could have been spent on someting worth while and interesting such as watching the grass grow, or picking my teeth. It was a real disappointment and the reading of this book by anyone with a life should by outlawed."
0,"What a major disappointment this movie was. It's just a bunch of horrifying images with little to no character developement. Was I supposed to care about these women or just watch them all die and hope I find the death scenes enjoyable? And exactly how many centuries would it take for humans to become bat like is beyond me, but I don't think it would have happened just yet. And how strong are these things? They can take down large game and wolves but a 110 pound woman can take out 4 of them at the same time? Whatever. The deleted scenes are horrible and deserved to be deleted, maybe they should have deleted the whole movie. I gave it 2 stars just because the movie was somewhat watchable until the end. What the hell was that anyway? If it would have ended with the dream getaway I would have said it was a bad movie, but the actual ending made me dislike it even more. I say you should waste less of your time and get the Cave instead. I even liked Dog Soliders, what happened?"
0,"I purchased another MK315 because I smoked the first one during an electrical storm. I received my Minn Kota MK315 and the first thing I noticed was the poor packaging from AMAZON.com. As heavy as that unit is, they tossed it in a box with a couple of piece of bubble wrap which allowed the unit to beat the outside box and unit box to pieces. Since it was left on my doorstep, wasn't much I could do. Upon installation, the ""Power"" light did not work. Unit seems to charge all three batteries fine. Minn Kota says there is no warranty because I cut the power cord to install in the boat. In their words; ""The MK-315 is a reliable charger. It is unlikely that the charger was defective right out of the box. Unfortunately because the AC plug was altered the warranty is now void. The chargers are a sealed unit and cannot be repaired."" I do believe that will be the last Minn Kota charger I buy!"
1,"If I read one more scathing review from some so-called music critic I am definitely going to have to start cancelling some subscriptions! This is a great, great album! It's so nice to actually be able to understand the words and Mr. Aiken's voice is just incredible! I went to work today with the lyrics running through my head and a smile on my face! I am so tired of critics trying to categorize Clay's music. I'm probably the last person who expected to be so connected to Clay's music. Two weeks ago I got a speeding ticket on the way home while listening to Aerosmith! There's just something so wonderfully refreshing about Clay and his music!"

But this love affair is tragic because the man is at the end of his charm and can only regress, whereas she represents the new style, the new era that is opening at this moment and she goes up so fast she crushes her husband into oblivion and non-existence. But she remains faithful to her love, and he does not want to block her in her career. So he commits suicide to free her road and she nearly cracks up and goes away. But she can stick to her career by assuming his name as hers. A very sad film about the film industry and its law of the jungle.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

0,"I am sorry to say, but this book was without a doubt, one of the wrost books I have ever read in my life. The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring. When I first read the book, I had heard great things about it, but when I read the book, I was very disspointed. Take my advise, don't read the book."

0,"First of all, I highly recommend people be very careful ordering a movie with no reviews and/or no details about the release. This movie The Whistler is NOT even a full length feature film. It is a very short 60 minute movie that someone made for next to nothing over one weekend. Also Amazon should have noted this DVD is not a regular DVD release but a DVD-R cheaply made movie. In all honesty this release is something I would see in a local store for $1 and I would not even give it a thought. Absolute junk and I feel ripped off. Shame on Amazon for selling this trash...."
1,"My brother and I count Roger Rabbit as one of the best movies ever made. We used to have all-day Roger Rabbit festivals, where we would watch the movie over and over again. The movie is THAT fun. I venture to say it is a movie for all ages. Adults will find subtle humor that will go over kids heads, and kids will love the animation and slap-stick jokes. This is one of the most visually amazing movies ever made, and you forget that most of the characters are cartoons. This is a movie where the toons truly come to life."
1,"Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."

1,"""A World Within a World"" says it all. This is probably the best CD I own. I absolutly LOVE silverchair, I have been a fan since they first came out with ""Tomorrow"". This CD just proves how diverse and talented they are. Daniel Johns (lead singer) has such a beautiful and magestic voice.It definitely makes all troubles go away by just listening to it. It is soooo great to hear these bright and happy lyrics. I am looking forward to hearing much more from them."
1,"I waited for so long to get this CD and I had hoped that it would be what I expected, but it was so much more. I love every song on it and I guess my favorite changes from day to day. Right now my favorite is THE WAY. I think it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I wanted to write this letter and really blast the critics but the more I thought about it I realized that that isn't the CLAY-WAY. I understand that we can't expect every body to love it like Clay's true fans do but we just have to stick behind him and let him know that the people who truly love him are estatic about the CD and we are so proud of him for sticking to his beliefs and not letting the producers talk him into compromising what he believes in. We want more of the Clay we love, and we will stick with you forever."

1,This is by far my favorite and the best chocolate bar I have ever eaten!!!!! YUM!!!
1,"This album is truely amazing. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are funny yet full of truth, and her voice is awsome. The songs are full of crude humor as she talks extensively about drinking and sex. Somehow though, even a more conservative girl like me can grow to loooove her music. The reason is because of how deep her lyrics can be, even though, at a first lisen, it might not appear that way. Her songs can range from very funny like, The World is Full of Bastards, which almost any girl can relate to, and guys laugh about, and Mata Hari, about a fake and slutty girl to more somber like Takes His Place, about relationships never working out. Her songs speak to everyone as she speaks about messing up in life and about bad relationships. Everyone needs to get this cd, support lil local bands...also see her in concert, that is the most amazing experience!"
0,"Like other 1-star reviews, this warmer barely kept the coffee warm. And like most other cheap electronic products, the cord was too short; just enough to reach the floor with about two inches to move around. Also, don't waste your time trying to actually warm coffee, as it took about an hour and a half to go from room temperature to warm."

0,"Clay knocked my socks off on American Idol, and I will always believe that he should have won. His interpretations of familiar pop tunes and standards were awesome. That's why the CD was disappointing. Comprised of unfamiliar tunes, and without his exciting stage presence, this CD is completely unremarkable. I'm sure it was popular with the teenyboppers (the CD includes a mini-poster), but his fan base is much, much broader. Clay, if you're reading, we'd like to hear more of your unique interpretations of familiar music. Pick a decade, pick an era, pick a genre. You have the potential to be a icon and not just an idol, but it won't happen with stuff like this,"
0,"I used this to study for the recertification exam in the summer of '09. I passed the exam, but I'm not sure how much this book helped. It focused a lot of questions on certain diseases that were not on the exam, and some diseases that were hit multiple times on the exam were never mentioned in the book. Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous mistakes and dated practice guidelines in the book. If I had to do it over again, I would try a different book."
0,"After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Although I have a reasonably fast PC 3.06 Ghz and a fair video display, the game is slow and jerky and it crashes or hangs up constantly. Having played all the TR games this is by far the worst. I will be trying to get my money back on this one. If you haven't already bought it don't waste your time or your money."

I could not find one thing that didn't have a logical explanation regarding the spiritual way of looking at things. It is bealtiful, positive, and only talks about love. It has helped me see life in a different way and respect God's work. I learned that he is in charge at all times, protecting us, and will give us eternal life. This knowledge will help you cope better with every day life issues, tragedies, etc. I hope everyone in the world would read this book and live accordingly, which will happen with time."

1,"This is one of my favorite albums. The score for this film was extrodinary and the original music performed by Deborah Lurie was absolutely gorgeous.The top 5 songs of the soundtrack:1. ""It's Alright"" by Peace Out featuring Chris Logan (Black Sabbath cover)2. ""Tim's Song"" - Deborah Lurie3. ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" - Postal Service4. ""Baby Hold On"" - Nina Khoury5. ""Waterfall"" - I-94This is the very best cover of ""It's Alright"" I've ever heard. Guns N Roses tried it once but this one is slightly better. It's a beautiful song and was a fantastic choice for this movie. The lyrics and overall sound of the song fit the story and pace of the music perfectly. So kudos to them for choosing to re-record it."
1,"I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have."
1,I am currently in school for my bachelors in culinary and this book is a must have for all students i believe i have only started to read it but so far it is great
1,"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."
1,"Purchase this to lay on ground before putting mulch down. Worked great, very heavy plastic, would purchase again. I see this lasting years under the mulch."
1,"I wish Max Keeble was my father. He repersents all that is good & just in the world, and is the point of my obsession. However, the way they repersent the fat kid, I believe Robe was thy name, is perposturous and insulting towards my superior intelligence. He is constantly getting stuck ( Winnie The Pooh syndrome ), and the other kids generally avoid him. I think the incredible brain trust behind Max Keeble hate fatties. With that said, the rest of the movie was suprisingly realistic and my favorite scene is where the sk8er kid sk8s around the school, because sk8boarding is kewl.Why did they make the popular girl seem like such a jerk? IT WAS HER SEAT... The principal scared me a little bit, with his insane hi-jinks and all...The Saga Of Max Keeble makes me proud to be an American. Wear the red, white, and blue proud Max. Wear it proud."
0,This item is not worth the money. It takes between 80 and 120 minutes to cook brown rice. My $49.00 Sunbeam steamer that I purchased 5 years ago cooks rice much better than the Zojirushi.
1,I still can't believe that this is a used book. I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O
1,"This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie."
0,"There are two mistakes about this DVD. The English title for this Italian movie should be either Bread, Love and Dreams (original: Pane, amore e fantasia) or Bread, Love and Jealousy (original: Pane, amore e gelosia). The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them. Both movies were directed by Luigi Comencini and not by Vittorio de Sica. Boudu Saved From Drowning is a very famous Jean Renoir movie from 1932. Both Italian movies are very good, but the one star is because of these mistakes."
0,"This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
0,"What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!"
0,"The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again."
1,"This is an excellent adaptation that leaves out some of the more sinister elements/overtones. There are no bawdy barroom scenes. Levity is provided by the addition of several animals. Oliver has a pet toad named Squeakers, Fagin has a parrot that ""parrots"" back Fagin's words (even when it gets him in trouble), there are a few more birds in the thieves abode and a cat. Naturally the cat scraps with Bill Sike's dog Bullseye, providing a comedic break.Other than being somewhat disappointed/annoyed by the lack of ""color"" in Fagin's voice, I found this thoroughly entertaining. It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back."
1,"I was trying to catch up on my classics when I ran across this book. I can honestly say that it was one of the richest, most fulfilling books I have EVER read. A book that truely has stood the test of time, ""A Tree Grow in Brooklyn"" will always have a place in my heart. Exelently portrayed characters leave someone that every young woman can identify with."
0,"This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features."

1,"To think that British Intelligence created this allusion to fool the Nazis during World War II is just magnificent. A ripping good yarn. Well done Amazon.com. This DVD is not released in AUSTRALIA. Making the purchase on line was simple, quick and easy. Regards Mr. T J SOMERVILLE, GAWLER EAST, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA"
0,"In this book, Davy does something bad and has to make amends for it before his mother gives him a loving hug.As a mother trying to teach love and forgiveness to my young son, I was horrified at the moral of withholding love from a child to ""teach"" a lesson. The book is off our reading list and in the trash can."
1,"I always loved Wu and Ghost, so i had to check this out, not knowing what to expect, cause Wallets was just aight. I was def impressed by this album. I saw the single with Missy and I thought Ghost went pop, but after hearin the whole thing, all can agree, this is HOT. Check out ""Metal Lungies"" and ""Run"" for some hot D-Block verses from Jada, Sheek, and SP. ""Holla"" is just Toney rhymin over an old Delfonics song, not sample, the whole song! I hear this song on the Muzak workin at Price Chopper, make me crack up. Hottest track on this album tho, for me at least, ""Be This Way"". Good sample, hot hot beats, some REAL lyrics from Ghost, good message. Like he says on the intro, new label, same Starks......and a HOT album."
1,"This is the first album I have truly enjoyed for many, many years. I loved every track. They gave me chills and tears! He is destined for greatness. Expect this album to top the charts for months and set all kinds of records!!"
1,"This was a great book. I must admit that some parts of the book, some of the chain of events seemed unrealistic and this frustrated me a little bit but it did not keep me from wanting to read more. I was ready to give the three and a half stars until I reached the end, where I was hit with sorrow that the book was coming to an end and the characters had grown on me. The ending had a huge effect on me and was symbolic in that life goes on but you will never forget the hardships and the happiness that made you who you are. From the beginning of the book, I felt attached to the serene 1900s Brooklyn setting of the book and I can only imagine the blend of hardship and morsels of happiness that those times brought to a child and his/her family. I was very sad to say goodbye to the characters in the book and goodbye to life in early 1900s Brooklyn."
0,"This is Jack jumping into the Budda scene. Good if you feel like you need a Zen fix, and his observations on how to aspire to happiness are actually quite good too."
0,"It's a great concept.... connecting A/V devices over a short distance without wires. However, the Rf Link system doesn't quite make it a reality. I tried very hard to use the system to connect a camcorder to a TV/monitor. Even at a very short distance of 10 feet, the signal continously drops. I even tried adding the ""optional"" Rf Link output booster. However, any movement near or between the transmitter and receiver (still at 10 feet) causes the signal to drop out.... totally unacceptable and unusable. The only happy note was Amazon's great customer service and return policy."
1,I am glad I bought this one to cross reference and for more thorough definition for my med term course; it got lots of vivid pictures which I even like. I highly recommend this book.
1,"Friend had me watch, ""Last Tango in Paris."" I couldn't find it in any video store so I immediately looked it up on Amazon.com and abracadra...it was found! Great price and was shipped quickly to my house. How convenient!!! Keep up the awesome work. I use Amazon for book club on a monthly basis and I am really pleased with everything. Wish I could get better shipping prices...For example, my last book was only a one penny, but the shipping was over 2 dollars. Wish you could ship more than one book, better price.Happy customer, Riley"
0,"My 5 month old never had diaper rash until she started using the Pampers baby dry (size 1) she doesn't even sleep for more than 4 hours at a time so she never sat in a diaper for much longer than that. I would never buy these again. In fact, we have tons leftover and I'd rather waste the money than subject my baby to them."
0,"I would not buy this again - it teaches a non-standard supposedly ""new"" methof of casting"
0,"There have been many comparisons of Oasis to the Beatles, often by the band itself; but Noel Gallagher cannot draw the distinction between inspiration and imitation. On their first two albums, they got away with mere imitation just because they came up with some pretty infectious melodies. But on this album, the melodies aren't even there. They've fallen victim to their own hype and have created a monster. For God's sake, do not buy this album. ""All Around the World"" is the best song, although like the rest of the album, someone should have turned off the studio tape halfway through the band's performance. Way too long and tedious. And if Noel is one of the richest musicians in England, can't he afford some cleaner production?"
1,"This book is mind boggling. Next to the Bible, it is the best book I have ever read. It is very clearly and concisely written and very practical in its application. No one who applies these principles can ever be defeated!!!"
0,"I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right. And if you get motion sick easily...well, Taz pretty much spins a lot. Enough said!"
1,"I was not so impressed with the video quality. It was a bit grainly, but better than the DVD copy. Blu-ray gives you the newer lossless sound that will rock your world. You will feel like you are in the bar.I recommend this because of the sound quality and it is worth the upgrade if you like this movie."
1,"was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50.8 version. Thus far it feels good and i would definately recommend the use of this product"
0,"I think it's such a shame that an enormous talent like Clay Aiken is pigeon-hold into making an album like ""Measure Of A Man"". Aiken's voice is soaring and wonderous throughout this disc, but the lyrics and arrangements of each track, excluding ""This Is The Night"" and the title track, are downright insipid. Think Backstreet Boys go Broadway. Clive Davis, the album's head producer is a bonafide hitmaker, but even he has to hang his head in shame at allowing this drivel to be sold to Aiken's fans. From the interviews that I've read and seen on TV featuring him, Clay seems like a decent human being, and has a voice that will mealt your heart. But, I strongly advice any serious music lovers to avoid this disc and wait for something more mature and stronger musically from Clay Aiken the vocal wonder."
1,"I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
0,"I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
1,"I've heard from alot of people how boring this book was. For me it was ok. I love the plot but the whole setting in the 1600s was what I didn't like, and one chapter was all dedicated to some political guy, I didn't like that either. So some parts are really boring other are ok and other are REALLY good, for example the last part, I love that part. I love that sorta thing."
0,"I have finished this book with only 2.5 days.I feel very disapointed because this book mainly tell you what the features are avaliable in the Small Business Server 2000.This book hasn't tell you how to use them, how to deploy them.The style of the book is many titles in a chapter, but there is only a few words talking the title.I feel that the author is saying like ""There is Remote Access Service with SBS 2000. Then bye bye.""This book is too details for manager/decision maker, but not enough for administrator, so I don't know what this book for."
1,"Fort Apache is another wonderful example of Fords amazing directing ability! It's a pity that he is still not around to make more of these classic epics.John Wayne does a spectacular job playing Kirby York. A brilliant if somewhat bitter character, who has spent a major portion of his life fighting Indians and is therefore much more aware of the danger of fighting them as if they were civilized soldiers who obey the tactics of war.Henry Ford, as usual does an incredible acting job, as the ignorant Colonel Owen Thursday, who's pride gets him into much more trouble then it's worthI can't say that I actually ever rooted for the Indians (who did a wonderful job of appearing uncivilized) which I suppose is how it's supposed to be :-) And I was highly disappointed that Owen never made it back. Even if he WAS a disagreeable person.Fort Apache is a must see! A GREAT video!"
0,"I've been a fan of Ry Cooder's recordings for a long time, but noe I prefer him more like producer of other artist's records (listen to the latest M. Staples one..). ""My name is Buddy"" should be changed in ""My name is BORING"": I can save only 4/5 good songs (NOT masterpieces) in this cd, the sound is disjointed and the voice of Ry seems is really too tired...Finally, listening to the latest Ry's album, my favourite remains Chavez Ravine, that is strange and not perfect, but much better than Buddy!"
0,Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.
1,"The Greatest Generation is a fabulous piece of work which transports the reader back to the 1940s and then goes on to show how it's survivors went on to influence our world. Upon completion of the book I began to think, how will my generation affect the world?"
1,"I like the simple design of Noritake Colorwave dishes, but was unhappy with gray marks from metal tableware. I have discovered that the right dishwasher detergent takes care of this. I was using a phosphate-free powder, for ecological reasons, but it was not getting my dishes clean. Researching this, I learned that in the last year, phosphate-free dishwasher detergents have improved a lot, so this problem may go away by itself. Otherwise, try a different phosphate-free detergent; the tablets seem to work best."
0,"I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. After three months and only sporadic use, the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously. This isn't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in, but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds, then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on. I contacted the company, which confirmed it was faulty, so I sent it back to them for replacement. I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months, the second one started doing the same thing. I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product. I suppose there is a reason that it's a third the cost of the Apple product."

0,"I began reading this novel since it has such a great reputation as being a ""classic."" However, after reading well over a hundred pages, the book failed to keep my attention in the least bit. The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."
0,I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it.
1,"Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan."
1,"Living in Chaos is Living in Stability is truly a book that has inspired me to be more aware of my spirituality and has shown me many ways to do this. It is a book that has brought peace to my heart having read it right after September 11, 2001. If you are searching for more meaning in your life and comfort of your soul, this book is an excellent choice."
1,This book is very informative if your child has a brain or spinal cord tumor. It is broken into easy to read sections. The quotes from people who already lived through this were priceless. I helps put things in perspective for you. It gives you tips on how to deal with unusual circumstances. It has lots of resources for contacting other organizations on the web as well. Very helpful for me and my family.
1,"Typical Steven Berry book - action thriller with a historical/fact base. A quick read that keeps the pages turning. I enjoy these books immensely - but this particular book is a little far fetched for me with heavenly appartitions and such.Having siad that, it is great entertainment, and provides enough interesting historical tidbits that it remains classic Berry and a good read."
1,"The toner in my HP Laserjet 2100 finally ran out, and so I couldn't justify spending $100 for a new toner when my local office supply store had the 1020 on sale for $80. I read all the reviews on Amazon and TigerDirect and decided that this was the printer for me. I had no problems with my old printer and wanted another HP.Installation was easy. I followed the instructions and installed the CD first. I bought the usb cable from Amazon - Belkin gold series, 10ft for around $10. This printer is so much smaller than the 2100, but it does everything my old one did, just faster and with a smaller footprint. It is also very quiet. Everything worked beautifully and I expect this printer will last as long as my 2100."
1,Great factual read. Very similar to dan Browne style novel. If you like dan Browne you'll love Steve berets well written to the point novel. Great read.
0,With 100s of unreleased tapes in the archives all Universal can do is re-hash old stuff again and againThe CDs are classic Allmans but why a box set ???
0,I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....
1,"Many think that this album is inferior compared to other Cream albums. This is my favorite Cream album, Clapton's guitar work is beyond compare. ""Spoonful"", ""I Feel Free"" and ""Sweet Wine"" show Clapton's talent as a top guitarist as well as his talent as a blues musician on blues songs ""Sleepy Time Time"", ""I'm So Glad"" and ""Cats Squirrel"" as well as his lead vocal on ""Four until Late."" Gingers drumming is also at its peak on his showpiece ""Toad"" as well as doing more than keeping time on ""Sweet Wine"" and others. Jack Bruce's range as a vocalist combined with his talent as a bass and harmonica player are shown on this album more than on any other Cream Album. Though many of the songs aren't original, they sound like no other band when coming from Cream. I would take this album over any other made by Cream, or any other band!"
1,I love this product. This is my 2nd one because the gears stripped on the first one. I like it so much I hunted around until I found one I could afford. I'm hoping this one will last longer.
1,"This is a collection of Forsyth's short stories. They are thrillers with political background to some extent. They sometimes have some comical scenes as well. I like 'The Emperor', because I think it's a twisted version of ""The Old Man and the Sea""."
0,"The videography of the trains is outstanding. Unfortunately, the host is about as obnoxious as they come. Screaming, jumping around, arms flailing, and extremely dumb dialog (you can see just about everyone he interviews/works with cringes at the things he says). On top of that, the rapid jump cutting is enough to make you want to hurl. No joke! Most of the scenes shot of Matt's dialog is with the camera right on the ground pointing up towards him while he's shouting at the camera flailing his arms around.This could have been an excellent series, but it is ruined and unwatchable by the script and host. I'm shocked that anyone liked it."
0,"I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it."
1,"...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!"

0,"I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)"
0,"This book, was far too long, and was not at all appealing. The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories."

0,"Eric Flint calls this an ""oddball volume"" and a ""cross between a traditional anthology and a novel"" in the preface. I found it a bewildering mishmash, even the wrap up section at the end. The storyline jumps between characters and locations frequently, and the timeline jumps back and forth as well. The number of characters in play is astounding, and most of them are not the main 1632 characters. It was just plain hard to follow, and therefore hard to fully enjoy. For newbies, this is a definite DO NOT BUY. If you are a 1632 series experienced reader, go ahead, but be forewarned that this one falls a little short."
0,I kept getting an error message when trying to install it. I ended up having to return it unfortunately. sorry

0,"My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money."
0,"I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well."
1,"It took me a few times before I could honestly give this CD a five star rating, but it is worth it. Clay is so refreshing and is filling a music void. I hope he will continue on and reach his potential as a singer. We could use a few more like him."
1,"I'm not any sort of expert of musicals but all I know is I really enjoyed this when it came out and years later I still find myself whistling Evita songs every other day. It is memorable music and this movie/soundtrack is done in a very entertaining way regardless of how faithful it is to the original. The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music. Plus unlike many soundtracks that skip songs this one is literally THE sound track to the musical. I pushed play on the CD once while the DVD was playing and it was synchronized."
0,"Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!"
1,This book has given me some insights on how to solve problems either individually or as a team member. I'm not quite ready to accept all of the ideas but it does give me something to think about! I really liked the fact that it contains both theory and practical advice for both developers and managers!
1,"I really enjoyed this book!I couldn't put it down after the first page which compares Marshall, ""An average North American Male"" ... ""plump and balding"", to his caged pet bird - ""Both had lived three fourths of their expected life span and had another fourth of life to go, if they were lucky"".This sets the tone for the novel which is a thought provoking story written with wit and intelligence.I should note, however, this is not and it is a book about the character Marshall Hollenzer. It is really a book about people - the choices they make and/or the fate bestowed upon them - and journeys - both physical and spiritual.This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening.I recommend buying at least two copies - this is the type of book that you will want to share with people you know."
1,"Everyone should have this game. It is the perfect game for families because adults enjoy it as much as the kids. Even young kids can play, because there is no reading, just pictures on the dice. You start with some wooden mice and roll the dice to see if you put one in the cat bowl, take one from the bowl, pass one or do nothing. You never know who is going to win until the end, because even if you run out of mice early, there is a chance someone might have to pass you their's. The last person with mice wins. We have played games where only two people had a mouse at the end, but neither of them won because they had to pass them to other players. The game is small, easy to learn and a lot of fun. Buy it now, you'll be glad you did."
0,"The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
1,"As described, it works, should work for a while. Can be manually switched to the opposite cycle (on /off) but only until timer trips it again. Very bare-bones but if you want 20 amp or the T-slot this is it."

0,"Sorry Clay, I kept an open mind...but this CD is a corny, wimpy collection of out-dated pop. Clay should have stayed the red-haired, freckle-faced, 4-eyed christian singer that he once was. They have turned him into to a blonde, spiky haired howdy doody. My friends and I say......""CLAY NO WAY""!!!!!"
1,Witty and fun songs for everyone from as young as 2 to adult. Has a great message and highly recommended.
1,It bothers me a lot to see that almost everybody has been praising Usher as the R&B king. Hell no! Brian McKnight is the real deal. Usher is just a R&B beginner.
1,I love this slip. I bought this slip to wear under my dresses that came to my knees and this works very nicely.
1,"Excellent little book, specially for some of as, that came to this country a bit later in life, and need it to learn the language just like everyone that comes here."
1,"This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day."
0,Have not finished book yet but already getting tired of author plugging his DVD .Plug it at the end of the book but spare us from mentioning it multiple times in the book.
0,"Since my cats have always loved Cosmic Catnip, I figured they might also enjoy the treats. What a disappointment! Neither cat even nibbled, and when I left some outside for the neighborhood stray, he even passed! Save your money and just buy grocery store treats."
0,I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.

0,I've got one word for you: BORING! Just the thought of reading several sequels to this snooze-fest is enough to make me drowsy.
1,"Anderson followed up his debut with an equally strong album. By this time the formula for future Anderson albums was in place: strong honky-tonk originals, a love song or two, a novelty song and just plain hardcore country. Two songs from this album went Top 10 Country (""Chicken Truck"" and ""I'm Just An Old Chunk Of Coal""). There are no liner notes here, but the sound is excellent. Anderson was one of a select few who brought traditional Country back to the charts. If you're a fan of real Country than this makes an excellent purchase."
1,Excellent book. I've read all but a few pages. I was very touched by Mr Bok's description of his childhood as a slave. A few years ago I'd heard that the Sudan had some problems; after reading this book I have a little idea of those problems in general and of slavery in particular. I strongly recommend this book.
1,"Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)went to the haunted ""Hill House"" together with three other People, included Eleanor (Lilly Taylor), a bisexual Theo (Catherine Zeta Jones) and Luke (Owen Wilson). Everything seemes harmless... at the beginning of course. But it isn't! Strange things happening to the Guests of the ""Hill House""! Children are talking to them, Statues are moving and bloody footprint are leading them to mysterious places! All this is happening most of all to Eleanor. She is seeing things. Things that nobody else cans see...This is a hillerious Ghost-Story with breathtaking Special Effects and a just perfect ""Hill House""!!!Buy this DVD but beware: ""Everyone lives in Town three Miles away from here. Everyone leaves before Dark. Nobody will come any nearer than that, in the night, in the dark..."""
0,"let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate."
1,"I don't generally read science fiction, in fact, I never do. But with all the hype - or lack thereof - surrounding the bombed Disney movie, I decided to read the book before the movie comes out on DVD. Yeah, it's a little silly, but it's still a fun ride all the way. I enjoyed the nonstop action, John Carter's superhuman strength, his gentlemanliness (is that a word?) and his ability to bridge culture gaps and help the locals overcome traditions of hatred and prejudice. He is a southern gentleman to the core. It shows in everything he does, particularly in his absence of lust for the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris though she is buck naked and gorgeous. He adores her totally and completely and treats her like the royal lady she is the whole time."
1,"I normally don't like this kind of music but I really enjoyed ""Evita!"" It was surprisingly good for me and it will be ""surprisingly good for you."""
0,All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from.
1,I was looking for clarity and a picture that would completely fill my HD television screen without manipulation. I found it with this DVD and couldn't be happier.

1,"Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Plus, she is just plain funny. The video is divided into six ""classes"" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting. I highly recommend the set!"

0,"This movie sucks big time. It was so boring, dull, unfunny and a piece of garbage. Please do not waste your precious time or waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie makes Mariah Carey's glitter and wisegirls looks like a masterpiece. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't understand how cher got an oscar when Glenn Close was nominated for fatal attraction. Again I repeat, THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, IT MADE ME SICK. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MOVIE. STUPID CRAP. DON'T SEE IT. VERY VERY BORING."
1,"Not so much scary as it is interesting, however some decent performances keep you involved. The story is a little drug out, as this could have been much better at 90 min. as opposed to its 115 min. run time worth seeing never the less."
1,"An excellent book of ""Cat and Mouse"" (so to speak). I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy reading, interest....A real page turner with a twist."
1,"I recall the flurry of TV and print documentaries that appeared in 1984, all striving to answer the question ""How close are we?"" I thought that generally they missed the point.Yes, Orwell's classic was ostensibly about Totalitarianism, but on a deeper level, it is all about control. 'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled. And, to this day, it still sounds a prescient warning."
1,"I have been a big fan of the movie ""A Majority of One"" for many years. I have a ""tape"" of the movie, but was thrilled when the movie came out on DVD. Rosalind Russell is superb. The interaction between Rosalind and Alec Guiness is extremely pleasurable to watch from the time they met on the ship to their relationship in Japan. The scenes with Rosalind dressed in the Japanese Kimono were priceless. The ending was extremely enjoyable leaving the audience to draw its own conclusion on where their relationship would go."
0,"My son is 4 months old and we've been using Pampers swaddlers pretty much since birth. We bought the Baby Dry size two when they were on sale and it's been a horror show ever since. 120 diapers and there has hardly been a day since when we haven't had to clean up an explosive diaper. My son is breast fed and he's not on solid food so a diaper labeled ""baby dry"" SHOULD have done the trick but instead it is un-absorbant and thus very leaky. Even if the diaper hasn't shot the poo up my baby's backside while he was playing then when I place him on the changing table, it is sure to do just that, creating a mess. My husband wants to throw the diapers out, I want to give them away but it almost seems cruel to give them to someone."
0,"Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
0,Got these for Christmas from my wife. They looked great but it's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them. Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle. I do NOT recommend these.
1,nice oil for women - can't see much difference but sure looks large and in a great quantity - I'm sure it is helping on some level I am no aware of yet - highest mg I've seen out there - NOW seems a good company from the products I've had so far.
1,"Read more than the table of contents! Some people have obviously rated this book without reading it. The Author explains why some guns are included in the test and others are left out (in 2 Places in the book). The author also talks about and praises his personal ""Colt"" 1911's. So you Rampant Pony fans should not feel left out. This book is obviously not ground breaking as there have been many books about the 1911, but it is very informative (gunsmithing, tactical course, competitions,& reloading). It provides an indepth comparison of the wide variety of the modern makes of the 1911."

1,"Fort Apache is one of my husband's favorite movies, however, he is a huge fan of John Wayne, and loves watching many of them. He has a very large collection of them on VHS and now he is doing the same thing on DVDs.We both love a mystery, and westerns. If there is a little romance in them to, that is a bonus. Fort Apache is a western and full of adventure and movement. And it also has romance. A very good movie.Lu"
0,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed. Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in. Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distractionThe premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material. So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day."
1,This was brought for my husband to finish his set. He has all of the seasons. It was one of our favorite shows on tv and it will be missed . at least this way we can watch it over and over .
0,"I was a HUGE Clay fanatic throughout all the AI hype. I fell in love with his voice and his personality and dashing good looks. However, this CD disappointed me. The voice that I fell in love with was his ""live"" voice, and I don't like his ""studio"" voice very much. I like 2 or 3 of the songs on the cd, but it makes me sad to give it a bad review, because I was looking forward to this cd since May."
0,"Really bad supernatural thriller that has Keanu Reeves of all people trying to save the world from the devil and his army in a piss poor movie with a bad script and poor special effects. Reeves comes off very bad in his role and basically leaves Rachel Weisz to not only hold the audience by herself by giving the only good performance that this film has to offer but also to make them think that the movie would have been much better off with Keanu not there. Weisz's performance is the only good quality that this film has and she's so good in fact that you almost forget how bad this movie really is, int'l the script lets her and audience down with a very bad second act that not only takes apart the theme of the film but makes a mockery of it as well.Other than the good performace of Rachel Weisz, it's not worth your time."
0,"Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
1,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I was actually a little shocked at how deeply I loved it and how much I didn't want to put it down. A lot of times books written many years ago have a style to them that makes them a little less enjoyable to read. This didn't have that at all and I actually thought it was a new book just written about the early 1900s time period. The story really flowed nicely.One of the things I think that makes a book great is it's ability to change your perspective. This book really did that for me. In the way I think about money and education. I have a passion now to really succeed through college and get the career I have always wanted and I attribute a lot of that new drive to reading this book.In short, this book is an excellent choice when looking for a good read. It is now one of my favorite books of all time."
1,The book has good illustrations and it has the song five times. The illustrations go very nicely with the words to the song.
0,"While I know Brokaw is a newsman and journalist, too much of his linear style effects what are otherwise compelling stories of those who lived and fought for this country."
0,"I love the music of this old Christmas piece, full of memories. I've listened to it on records and CDs for years, but I wanted the visual effect of the opera, which I have seen onstage, live. This is a film of the original production;,uesbut sadly, the 1955 TV production values are a disappointment. I expected black-and-white, but the total effect is so much inferior to, say, a 1955 motion-picture film. That said, the voices are splendid!"
1,"This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet."
1,My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet.
1,"Like the other reviewers, I can no longer find this product on grocery shelves. I tried HEB, Target & Walmart and that's about the only choices we have here in Texas. For some reason, periodically, stores stop carrying them. They should not do this, as they are absolutely the best for cleaning tough baked on things, as well as quick swipes before putting dishes in the dish washer. I have been using them for more than 40 years!"
1,"purchased for two reasons: first, for a video presentation (connect to computer and speakers); second, for playing music at home and on the go. it works fine and is a great value for the money. buyer's remorses - would like a similar sized and quality product that has a remote control and bass/treble features"

1,"Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"
0,"This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad."
0,"I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there."
0,"For the money ~ I was very disappointed in these earring and I wrote to the seller right a way.I had to go away on a family reunion but I did not even bring them ~ they are not classey looking at all. For Chalcedony I was so sadly let down. Think Twice is my advice! Lynn C. ~ South Jersey, N. J."
1,"I bought this for the first time on a whim about three months ago. Love it, love it, love it. Love it on popcorn, crave it on my spaghetti (with a touch of parmesian cheese added to it). I eat spaghetti for lunch maybe four to five times a week now (no sauce). Don't know if that's good or bad, but I heap the nutritional yeast on it and love it. I'm definitely not a vegan (not that there's anything wrong with that, I just love me meats), but I feel good that this product is so full of nutrients. I don't know how it compares to other brands. I bought this brand first and it tastes great to me, plus the price is cheaper than some others out there, so I figure, why buy anything else?"

1,"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."
0,"Electrostatically removing particles works okay, but it requires a fan to move air over the grille. As others have mention consumer reports tested this product at it removed almost nothing from the air. It rated the lowest out of all the air cleaners they tested.So don't waste your money on this product. If you want an electrostatic air cleaner find one with a fan. Before you buy you should really go read the online Consumer Reports report because a lot of air cleaners don't work very well."
0,"I've read quite a few books on astrophysics, cosmology, etc., and this is one of the most poorly written books I've come across. It's too bad, because the writer is trying to be current and thorough. But he doesn't know how to write clearly, his grammar is terrible, he skips steps in his explanations, jumps all over the place, and leaves you wondering ""what in the heck is this guy trying to say??"". Not recommended."
0,"Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality."

0,"1984,by Georgee Orwell,is not fun to eat although cheese is. The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, ""Boring!"" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."
1,"I purchased this book reluctantly. It started out methodically(as THAT HIDIOUS STRENGTH) but had an ending that literally knocks your socks off. I expect a Christian theme with Lewis, but this story delved into more morphous questions of diety and love. Definitely one of Lewis's top five."
0,"Poor production from the early-mid 80's cannot be corrected with a ""remaster"" attempt. I purchased it directly from the company a few months back. With the greatest respect for the lady giving the sewing instruction who can be your best friend's mom up the street, the production values are so low and filming techniques so outdated as to be useless to observe. They make use of a mirror on her work surface, a camera does not go right into her work much of the time and contrasts are low. Editing was also very choppy at times. The resolution is so poor that I could not see critical details. It just isn't easy to see what she is doing half of the time.Good solid information is given for beginners but I cannot recommend this product. Not good value for the price. I honestly believe the company should scrap it (and the series assuming the rest are like this) and start over."
0,My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED.
1,"These books are flat out great. The author of the first and 3rd book is somewhat prone to typos, but aside from that these books just flat out rock. They did an impressive job of filling in the back story for Master Chief (John) and what became of the other Spartans before the start of the first Halo game. The recap of the events that transpired in Halo was wonderful too. Then the kicker; in the 3rd book there's a few Spartans left? What a way to lead up to Halo 2. Simply amazing stuff here, if you're a fan of the series anyhow but then again anyone reading this is bound to be."

0,"WARNING: This DVD is in 1.33 aspect ration, so you won't see the same film as the one in the theater.If you have a widescreen tv or 16:9 projection screen you'll have black bars on the left & right sides of your screen that will make this DVD look like a ""TV Movie"".Visually this was a stunning film, shot by one of the greatest cinematographers - Jordan Cronenwenth who also filmed BLADERUNNER, STOP MAKING SENSE, etc. It is such a disservice to him and the film to NOT release this as an anamorphic widescreen DVD so the homeviewer can enjoy the great visuals.WARNER Bros., we'll rather pay a little more, and get quality!4 stars for the film, 1 star for the DVD."
1,"When I heard this I was like, wow! His songs are great, and I'll admit, he's not the most handsome person, so on his CD you dont have to look at him. Oh, and today, everyone's voices are digitally remastered so they sound better, like * cough cough* Hilary Duffs *cough cough* but not Clays! he sounds just as good live as on his CD."
0,"I purchased this book thinking it was going to be a book specifically talking about Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, it wasn't.I would venture to guess that if you took the few pages about Chesapeakes OUT of the book, ALL of the books written by this author geared toward a specific breed would all read the same!Not a book to buy if you are looking for information on Chessies."

1,I live in Pennsylvania and I recently saw Corvus Corax play at the PA Ren. Fair. I was quickly in love with this bands music. I bought this cd at their show and it has quickly become one of my favorites. I love rare and uncommon music and this one sure pleased me. It amazes me how dedicated this band is and how each song sounds a bit differnt then the last. This is a great cd for anyone who likes music that is a bit differnt then everything else.
1,"With 120 knots/bends/etc, this is perhaps not definitive, but certainly complete for almost any usage. It is profusely illustrated with clear, easy-to-read photographs, and has easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions. Covering everything from the most basic to the decorative, with suggestions for the use of each, it would be a practical and beautiful assistance for anyone who has always wanted to know how to tie those nifty knots."
0,"I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to. But it has a serious safety flaw/problem!!:The kit came with no instructions, so I was figuring out how it worked, and as I was turning the screw on the side of the barrel, the sharp pointed 2 inch pin needle inside the barrel shot out like a projectile dart. It was spring loaded and the screw is what held it in.Luckily it wasnt aimed at myself or anyone, because it could have caused serious injury. After the pin shot out I was left feeling very disturbed that this tool could have taken out my eye out.So, I feel compelled to warn and advise others who might be buying this tool set."
0,"I can't share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers.In my opinion, this is a book for advanced fishermen, who already know about fisheries ethics, or don't care about it. The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved."
1,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
1,"Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
0,"Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,The book was bought as a gift for my brother. He likes it and we were very pleased with speed of delivery and service.

This commercial plays so often that everytime I hear that voice my skin crawls...so basically, everytime I turn on my television.Had she been on American Idol she would have been voted off by now...who do I call to get this commercial voted off TV? Can you imagine Simon having a critique on this vocalist? William Hung, you don't have to worry about your career...Vanessa is no threat to you.Of course, she is the one TV and I am not..."
0,"You can't throw out the baby with the bathwater! If you feel that our Judicial system is flawed because it is not being held accountable - wouldn't that be an argument for more checks and balances not less?So then what is this really about? I believe that the author is afraid of social evolution (as evidenced by her other books.) Although I don't understand why she is - without it she couldn't be an author, lawer, columnist, AND be the mother of six. Anyways, she would like to replace our judges with know it alls like herself. She does a good job of presenting the facts that back up her agenda, but she misses any evidence of how the system that she proposes would be doomed to fail. After all, history shows us the ugly death of all previous Theocracies. If you are afraid of moving forward, this book is for you. If not save your money for a book with more balance."
1,"Long ago in californialand, i heard the last everly brothers ""hit"", on the wings of a nightingale, 1 time and i knew I HAD to have it. Took me about 20 years to find it, in this album. If you really like good music, with tight harmonies, good guitar work, words you can understand, a little bit of country and early rock to the still bitchin, fresh,updated sound of nightingale, then STOP RIGHT HERE and get this album. Enough said!"
0,"Vista has been out for 4 years, I'm up to Windows 7, and they still haven't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what's called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?"

0,"The first part of this book started off pretty good. I was able to do and understand the simple login application. After that, it made me feel pretty stupid. I completely lost focus due to lack of examples and the ever compounding lecture on tough topics. When it came to the final Artimus application, which is basically a huge conglomeration of just about every possible thing you can do, I was completely lost and couldn't get it working with WSAD. I gave up, i'm getting a different book."

0,"It seems virtually impossible to just contact Amazon and tell them there was a problem with my order without writing a review or packing up the diapers in the huge box, printing out a mailing label and returning them. The diapers I've been ordering monthly (Subscribe and Save) for a long time came and when I opened the plastic packing, they appeared to have been pre-wet. They had that crunchy, beady texture that diapers get when they are exposed to water. Of course, the whole reason I have them on order monthly is because I need them regularly and these came just in time-- I had run out of diapers. I have 3 kids, 3 and under and I can't easily get to the store to get more diapers so I had to use these gross diapers on my daughters AND now I have to return them to get a refund?? Something is broken with this system."
0,"It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."
1,"This book was really moving for me. I read it in 8th grade and still remember it. I especially loved the symbolism of the tree, that was very moving. The characters are very memorable and the language very easy to understand. Some parts get a little tedious but still a great read!"
0,"This product does its job, but not very well. All the end pieces, except the shovel, and the handles have to be attached to the rods. The poker, the main tool used, does not fit on the rod very well, and will spin loose when trying to move a log. My husband said he will weld it on so it won't move. Would recommend a different product, probably something that is constructed of one piece."
1,"As a beginner knitter, I was intrigued by Aran and Fair Isle knitting especially since my ancestry is of the regions mentioned in the book. Although I haven't tried any of the patterns, the book is laid out well and the patterns are clearly written and understandable. I will update my comment after I get around to making something from the book."

1,"Having just lost (though not really) a great friend and mentor two weeks ago Sunday, I was desperately looking for consolation in my grief. I found this book in a near by bookstore convinced that my friend had herself gifted me with it. Because her passing was very sudden and shocking, the first part of the book did not call out to me but the parts on what happens afterward were immensely consoling. The quote by Karl Rahner alone is worth the price of the book and its found on p.129.A beautiful and compassionate gift to all believe."
1,Michael puts so much passion and feeling into everything he sings.This CD really high lights his great talent and range. He cansing a song that you've heard others sing but when he sings it heputs so much power and feeling into it that it sounds like a brand newsong. I listen to this CD everyday because it is so relaxing &I love all the songs on it. One of my favorites is BRING HIM HOME. I have just about all of his CD's but I think this is my favorite. I think he is probably one of if not the best singertoday. He can sing any kind of music & make it sound wonderful.
1,"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of many of Adam Sandler's movies. I thought he was funny on ""Saturday Night Live"" but I find many of his movies dissappointing. Some I find just not good (""Zohan"") while others I find good for a while then they lose steam.(""Chuck & Larry"", ""Click"" ""Spanglish"") Most of his movies I'll find some funny or amusing bits but not enough to sustain a whole movie. I keep watching Sandler movies and finally I've found one that is very good from start to finish.""50 First Dates""_is a very good movie with a clever premise, a good script and a good supporting cast, especially leading lady Drew Barrymore. I've liked some of his other films (""Big Daddy"" ""Bedtime Stories"") but not as much as this one. It shows that given a good script, Sandler can make good movies. A very solid 4 stars here."
0,"I'm very upset after receiving my ""Crocodile Dentist"" game. Once I got it out of the Amazon box, I realized right away that this was not the game made by Hasbro sold in the US. It's very obvious just from looking at the game box, which is cheap, says ""CrocoDileDentist"" on it, and is full of oddly-phrased sentences with typos, punctuation errors, and grammer mistakes. The toy does work, but it is VERY cheaply made. If I wanted this toy, I could have gone to alibaba.com and ordered one from China myself for 1.75. Instead I paid 11 dollars for the REAL toy, and got this one. As another reviewer said, it does have a ""used"" look about it right out of the package. Especially on the bottom of the toy. I am very disapointed. I've never had an experience like this on Amazon, and I've bought hundreds of items. This seller gives this sitea bad name."
0,"I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music."
1,"This was a great story from start to finish as other reviewers have stated. Danny is a waiter at a local restaurant when Ariana and her controlling mother and her companion stop in for lunch. Ariana's mother is controlling of her because Ariana is deaf and feels she needs to make all of her daughter's decisions for her even though she is 21! It is love at first sight for Danny, although Ariana's mother doesn't think Danny is good enough for Ariana and does whatever she can to keep them apart. Kent Moran also performs his own music in this movie which is great! There are a couple more twists to this movie that I don't want to give away. Great tear jerker romance worth having in your movie collection."
1,"This Meguiar's wash and wax kit is an incredible value and the products are great. Meguiar's started as a furniture polish manufacturer 100 years ago. Over the years they've been perfecting their cleaning and polishing products (no, I'm not a Meguiar's employee! I just like to learn about the history of things). The Quik Detailer sprays are great for cleaning in a pinch. Washing and waxing with Meguiar's results in a great shine. The wheel cleaner is easy to use and my wheels look great.If you priced these out separately (even here on Amazon), you would pay AT LEAST 3 times the price for what you get in this kit. If you want to clean and detail your own car, this kit is hard to beat."
1,"I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies."
0,"Quite aside from the historical gaffes-- which are many and well documented by others-- it's a really lousy movie because the characters are so clumsy. Everyone is nasty to everyone else. Bad attitudes pass for 'drama.'I thought it was the worst movie on the subject of all time, but have recently seen the newer ""The Red Baron."" While that movie has much nicer airplanes, it has its own long list of historical absurdities-- I think it 'wins' the race to fairy tale.But on top of that, the dialogue is so silly and the editing so chopped up that you can't even follow the storyline.So ""Von Richthofen and Brown"" is only the 2nd worst movie on the subject. Still awful."
0,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I jumped once, but that doesn't make a scary movie. The first half of the film, nothing happens.. they all meet up, try to appeal to the male crowd by being all female, and you have all the typical characters. The know-it-all, the one with a bad past, the cocky one, etc. The reason this is not ""intense"" is that you see the creatures completely, they look like naked people that are all greasy (it's not a sexy as I just put it). and even the ending... spoiler... you don't know if she sees her friend who either somehow, impossibly made it out, or she is seeing it in her head, like she was doing throughout the movie. This is not even worth renting at the store."
0,"This book is not even worth reading, Mason Malmuth may have been a player in his day, but the game has passed him by a long time ago. This book could actually damage your poker game if you took the advice he gives. Nits no longer win in today's aggressive game and that is a fact. Mason malmuth is a dinosaur who's days are long gone."
0,"This series was a disappointment. The narrator, Diane Ackerman, apparently an author in her own right, gives a disjointed, rambling discussion of the five senses, with bits of science (interviews with actual research scientists, which Ackerman is not) joined to rather arbitrary examples of how the senses are involved in various cultural activities. Ackerman's examples are often a bit of a stretch, and her monologues are full of distractingly florid language. Kind of a New Age/postmodern pseudo-anthropological view of what science knows so far about the senses. I believe that Ackerman was trying to convey sensuality in her delivery, but I found myself increasingly annoyed by her throaty-yet-girlish voice, heavy make-up, and grating self-involvement. There was too much of her and not enough science. There are far better Nova series out there, and I'm sure that there are better programs about the five senses. I don't recommend this series."
0,"I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"
0,The stories of the people depicted in the book are interesting. Ranging from really interesting to somewhat interesting. These were people that made a difference and deserve our respect. However the book is poorly put together. It seems as if I am watching a TV show on paper. A poor end result. Would not recommend.
1,"Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs."
1,"Buy it and listen to it once and you will never want to turn it off. The songs are wonderful, and the way he sings them will move you in many ways. I was brought to tears by ""The Way"", it is so beautiful. Finally an artist who will not compromise his beliefs and delivered a great, personal debut album.A must buy!"
1,"I have only gotten interested in disco in the last few years, but now I am a huge fan. some of my faves include: Salsoul 12"", P&P Records Best of, Disco Connection Series, best of WestEnd, & 12"" Grand Series. However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers. Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music."
0,I am an avid reader and always have been pleased with Oprah's picks. This book however was painful to get through and I was so disappointed that I finally put it away for good. This is the first book I can honestly say I have never finished nor would ever like to. I have read other books by Gabriel Garcia Marquez but I certainly do not see this one as his best work! What a sleeper!
1,"Corey Rudl has put together a solid set of information here, with examples and specific strategies that work. I paid the $200 for the course and kept it, using one of the strategies paid for the course cost in a matter of days.I do agree that the book heavily promotes the company's software, but the process by which the author does this, to generate backend revenue, is in itself an excellent example of internet sales and cross selling in action. The promotion is a bit overdone re: the authors mailloop and other software programs, but, there are other programs out there as well.I got excited about the ideas, and ramped up several new strategies, eg emails and affiliate programs, immediately on reading the book and am doing well with it.Hey if you don't like it he has a lifetime guarantee on the book, that's pretty confident. I've returned many junky books, this course is not among them, a 'keeper'."
1,"This is a great video and an awesome workout. I was sweating and my muscles were feeling the burn. Oreet is not only an incredible dancer but she is also a great teacher. She explains what you need to be doing and she breaks down the movements. She makes sure that you are in the correct position and that you are using the correct muscles. I take actual belly-dance classes from her and this video is pretty much like being in class. Its fun, easy to follow and gives you a great workout. I highly recommend it.Diana"
1,"I have tried many different ways to store my very large array of shoes and this product is the best. It holds many shoes and takes up very little space in my closet. This is actually the second time I have purchased the shoe tree as I decided I needed another one for my other closet. It is very easy to find the shoes I need as the rack revolves and displays all of the shoes nicely. One can adjust the different tiers to accommodate different styles of shoes - pumps, flats, flip flops and varying heights of heels. Easy to keep clean and the base is solid. I have tried other brands [ from Bed, Bath & Beyond] but they were flimsy and the entire tree kept falling over as the base was not solid enough, so buyers beware of these cheap imitations! I definitely recommend this product- get a few!"
0,I don't often write reviews but I feel I need to. I have twin girls and have found that everytime I use Pampers they leak. The sizing is correct based on the label but they do not absorb enough through the night. I have had to change sheets many times. I do not find this happens with other diapers and Pampers are expensive.
0,It was so low that I could not hear it.I turned my volume up as loud as I could get it but still had toreally listen to get what was going on. also very dark . I loveSmallville & had watched it last night on t.v. but still did notenjoy this cause I could not hear it.
1,"Fits 8 oz. Gigi wax cans to the millimeter. Don't know how long it would take to liquify a full can, but doesn't take too long for a 1/2 full can. Compact, clean design, costs less than similar items marketed specifically as wax warmers."
1,"This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy."
0,"I am a little disappointed in the quality of the stainless on this product. I have an older 1 oz. version of this and it is really nice. The stainless looks like it is about to get rusty at any time if I don't dry it immediately and thoroughly after every use. Compared to my little one, the shine factor is just not even there. I regret not buying one of these about 15 years ago when I got my small one."
0,"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
0,"To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
0,"Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers movie look like Citizen Kane. I got about halfway through this movie before I had to stop watching. The plot was utterly nonsensical. I had no sympathy for any of the characters--the sooner Megatron kills Shia LeBoeuf the better--in my opinion. The action scenes were so convoluted, I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be happening nine times out of ten. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Michael Bay, Don't make another Transformers Movie."

1,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
0,"I do not have this edition. I got from another publisher. Anyway, I will comment on the content. Really fragmented information. Gives only description of cards. The meaning is still very very vague. Any other tarot book will excel this."
0,One of the three pliers did not work at all when I got it. I had to take a file to modify the thing so the locking mechanism would engage.
0,A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. THERE ARE NO PICTURES FOR IDEAS AND THERE ARE BASICALLY NO HOW TO'S FOR THE DO IT YOURSELFER. I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK. I ACTUALLY TOSSED THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WONT BE USEFUL IN ANYWAY. I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO A BOOK STORE. LESSON LEARNED.
0,"Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money."

0,Very disappointing! They could have chosen a more poised and sophisticated actress to play Audrey; Jennifer Love Hewitt's portrayal is an insult; in my opinion.
1,"The premise of cloning from a living celebrity kept my interest all the way through. The author's love of baseball and it's heros is evident. I couldn't put it down, had to rush to the very satisfying finish. Looking forward to more from Polidoro."
1,"There are fancier, lighter, more comfortable, more adjustable headlamps but this one puts out enough ligh to find your way in the dark and sooooo cheap"
0,"I am very disapointed that my teacher chose this book for my class to read. I feel it was very dull and boring, with nothing to keep the reader attentive. Throughout the entire book, there were no exciting scenes (there was one situation where the author could have made an exciting moment, but instead decided to turn it into a section of tasteless humor) and many of the chapters were about relationships between characters which were not explained enough to be interesting, or the various chores and jobs that the main character, Kit, did.I know there are many readers who enjoyed this book, but I personally do not like books who just tell the lives of someone unless there are some exciting events. Too many of the chapters of this book were wasted on petty happenings such as washing clothes or teaching someone to read. If you are looking for a book with excitement or adventure (which is what the title implies), I do not recommend this."

1,"This is one of my favorite CD's. Noel Gallagher knows how to write a song, and Liam's sexy voice brings them to life. Tracks 1-6, and 8 are the only tunes I listen to, however. Be Here Now is not one of those rare CD's you can listen to without skipping around. But, the songs I like don't get tired. If you want a hard-rocking version of The Beetles, buy this CD. If you want sensless lyrics with synthisized beats, check out The Backstreet Boys like everyone else."
1,This is a flawless film about the true atrocities of the Vietman War and one mans struggle to find justice for the innocent. Penn and Fox give first class performances in the film not to mention the brilliant supporting cast. This film is far superior to others of the genre.
0,"The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. I think this is kind of strange, considering one of the characters is going deaf."

0,We've watched three of the eight and find them hard going. I thought they would be historical but have found the plots to be mundane and predictable. Maybe the others will be better.
0,"The Bottom Line:Repeating the formula of the moderately-better ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise."
0,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE AMAZON KINDLE EDITIONNot worth having. The work is not scanned in properly. It lacks a hyperlinked table of contents.

That sort of spoils the moment so to speak.Heck the table of contentsR e a d s l i k e t h i sHow hard is it to do the job right?This publication detracts from the Kindle's reputation. Amazon ought to withdraw it."
1,"I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions . This is the best you can get to attending a class yourself. I felt engaged and involved in the class just by watching it on the Television. It covers everything that you need to know about childbirth and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go!"

1,"Mr. Pratchett is a very good writer, and while not every discworld novel is a knock out, none have been bad. Of all of his work this is my favorite. I reread it at least every couple of months. Bruthra and Om [pointy horns] spin a tale quite entertaining that keeps me coming back. I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do."

1,"I remember watching Three's Company on TV, and I'm so glad it's available on DVD now... I have all the seasons! Seaons One introduces the group, and the laughs don't stop! I laughed out loud at every episode in this season! I absolutely love Three's Company! It's just so funny and entertaining! John Ritter (Jack) is classic... one of the best comedians! And the interactions with Joyce (Janet) and Suzanne (Chrissy) always makes me laugh out loud. For a good laugh, and overall great entertainment, Three's Company is tops! Enjoy!"
0,Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it.
0,"This is the most boring book I've ever read. I didn't even finish it. Booker T. Washington is not a very good writer (which isn't surprising because he had very little education). Booker T. Washington was born a slave--interesting, was emancipated by Abraham Lincoln, then traveled from West Virginia to Virginia to go to school, graduated and then eventually got invited to start his own school in Alabama. So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting. Why don't we all just write autobiographies about ourselves because we feel like it?"

1,"There is no doubt that this album will have heads banging all over the world. If you listen to this second cd of this band (Toxicity), you will truly understand where this generation of rock bands is going. I don`t quite know what category this band (System Of A Down) fits into, maybe it's Nu-metal. For me, this album is simply the best albun of 2002. Serj Tankian with his naive and socially conscious lyrics and hypnotic weird vocal style is destined to become the Bono (U2 vocal) of Nu-metal. This Armenian album will make you hear a style of music that you will not find anywhere else. There are parts in some of the songs that are slower and then when you least expect they change into a heavy, head-banging style. I wish to see this Armenian band playing live here in So Paulo but it will take a long time, because the album has just been released. I suggest you give this cd a try, and when you find out that you love it, spread the sickness to your friends."
0,"my wife and I bought this cd over the weekend and the one word that comes to mind is depressing. It has none of the great tunes I expected from the likes of clay. he was always known for his use of ballads, but come one, how many songs does one need about losing your love or making it on your own without you....blah blah blah.I expected some powerhouse tunes, and wish he could have done some music for perhaps an upcoming Disney movie..."
1,I ordered for my son who doesn't like to read. Because of these books he is now a reader! Thanks so much!!!
0,This CD is not the music but a Drama CD. It basically has skits from the anime on it.Karin
1,"I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
1,I never thought about reading a religious fiction book before. To my surprise I found myself staying up just to get to the next chapter. Great read for everyone.
0,To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.
1,There are few books that I reference as much as this one. Almost every aspect of the homogenization of culture and individualism is realized in this book. You can not discuss world politics without reading this book. Just read the darn book!
0,I read the first 3 John Carter books and wanted to see how the story progressed. Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading. I realize he wrote during the last century and people did not realize Mars was what it was. I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!
0,"We have always used Pampers for our little boy, despite the price, with great results. When I saw the lower price on the Baby Dry, I was thrilled to pieces and thought it would be a great buy. These are the worst diapers we have ever put on our child. I have to change him much more frequently, I have seen more ""soak through"" episodes (the best was on my lap, in the middle of church), and he is clearly uncomfortable, pulling the diaper away from his skin. We have never had a problem with Swaddlers or Cruisers -- I say, stick with these."
1,"I have to admit I'm a recent fan of the Black Crowes and ""By Your Side"" was their first complete album that I listened to, but not the last. Because of this I album I got everything that they have ever released and I have to say, this one is definately their best. From ""By Your side"" to ""Go Tell the Congregation to ""Virtue and Vice"" there is not a minute of music on this album that does not rock. I read a biography of the band at the Apple music store and that writer said it best, ""This album is Criminally Under-Rated"". If you're a Black Crowes fan then you'll love this album."
0,"I love this series and would have enjoyed this one much more if it wasn't so full of typing errors, I don""t see anyone else complaining about this so maybe it's just my kindle. Did anyone else have a problem with this?"
0,The video version I ordered was not what I thought I was going to receive. I bought one to view and one to give as a gift. It was very dark with distorted characters and a great disappointment. It was hard to see at times and very unacceptable. In conscience I couldn't keep the one for me nor could I give the other as gift. That is why I returned both copies for a refund. Why do you not create a more modern colored version of Ahmal and the Night Visitors for a DVD?Thank you for reading my thoughts on this subject.
0,"If there was a way that i could give him less than 1 star, or even something in the negative numerical region, that would be it... cause uhh, this cd is DOODOO... why was it i couldn't even listen to the first 5 seconds? Umm... he's not the American Idol, give it up clay, your 15 seconds of fame is about to end... and Ruben Ate you up with his cd..."
1,"How appropriate that the end-credit score from a war movie was performed as Reagan made his final exit from his funeral. I was introduced to two incredible pieces of music from Princess Diana's funeral: the processional (Funeral Sentences) and the recessional (Alleluia by Tavener). Now there's this hauntingly moving music. I would expect a CD to be released of the funeral (perhaps to benefit Alzheimer's research). Meanwhile, there's this soundtrack, which will now forever be linked to Reagan's funeral. And even more, Nick Glennie-Smith has now entered a new realm for musicians."
0,"Helen Hunt was good, but what could her character have liked about Andrew McCarthy's character? At best he was annoying. And where was the comedy? Mocking someone for nearly drowning---how is that funny?The Amanda character was rather creepy.The best part was Helen Hunt singing Buffalo Gals like Donna Reed in It's a Wonderful Life. In fact the best parts of the movie were the scenes from It's a Wonderful Life.Not a movie I would recommend."
0,"That is all I can say - you get what you pay for is clearly underrated - you buy sheets for under 10 dollars - what on earth was I thinking - well, I got paper thin sheets that I hope make it thru the first washing -will use them as emergency sheets for guests that want a place to crash - will provide toilet seat cover-like protection against the mattress and who knows what it will feel like next to the skin!!

1,"The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to."

1,"This disc was played everyweekend at our parties, so much so it was almost a ritual. Not quite as good as Love Machine but still an awesome disc."
1,"This is a great album. Some of my favorite songs on there would be ""Special"" and ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". ""When I Grow Up"" is also pretty good. This is a great CD to travel with. They've definitely out-done themselves with this album. Great job!"
0,"Figured it had potential to be funny. But is wasn't, and not very interesting. Can't reccomend this movie to anyone."
0,"I read this out loud to my three children when they were young, only one stayed around till the end. Mind-numbingly dull unless one reads it with a funny voice or reads it as a sad tale of the narrator's unrequited love for Captain Nemo."
1,"I ordered this for a Christmas Party I will be attending this year. I ordered red, but became worried it would be more of a fire engine red...it actually turned out to be a deeper color and is GORGEOUS! I am absolutely happy with it. It was delivered quickly. I put it on this morning when I received it and it fits perfectly. The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom, so I'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit. However, I would recommend it...I'm a pretty big girl and it fits me well and looks great! Thanks!"
0,One of the blurbs on the cover said 'The Daughter of Time' was the best mystery ever written. I seldom give up on a book but this is one that I discarded about a fourth of the way into.Save your money.
0,"Horrible Keanu Reeves action film that is as bad as the word of mouth suggests and then some. Keanu's acting is so bad in this film that he even makes the dumb script with the horrible dialog look good in comparison to his performance. Rachel Weisz does give a great and lively performance but she's the only actor in the film who bothers to give one while the rest of the actors camp it up to the point of nausea (with the exception of Peter Stormare, who was great as the devil) The direction is a joke and lacks coherency plus the screenplay does not handle the subject very well at all with dialog that is horrendous and story structure that literally makes no sense.Thumbs up to Rachel Weisz and of Peter Stormare for at least doing their best with what was handed to them but the movie itself was horrible."
0,"Although this book was very well written, I couldn't understand it very well. I probably would not have finished it if it hadn't been required reading for school. I would think that older kids might be able to undertsand it, but that most of it is too subtle for eighth graders."
1,"I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."
1,"In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."
0,I would of given it 0 stars because it died 14 months after I purchase it(right out of warranty). I would have thought that for such an expensive product that would be more durable or have a longer warranty such as Cuisinarts 3 year warranty. I know that the main reason that people buyer this rice cooker is to make rice in it. But for $150 it really should have a slow cook and steaming function. You can buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker from Panasonic with both of these features for less and Panasonic rice cookers last a long time.
0,"Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers.

Threw it in the trash."
0,"Once upon a time, the Black Crowes were one of the best bands around. I thought Three Snakes... was disappointing, but I think that album is stronger than this one. The songs sound silly, with ridiculous lyrics and strained choruses that sound almost like glam-rock (Kickin' my Heart Around). If they don't turn things around, it looks like a once great band has burned out quickly."
0,The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.
0,"The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
1,"If, like me, you have lived in Montreal (or maybe just visited), you will LOVE this novel - even more if you enjoy thrillers... A true page turner...

He also holds a Engineering degree from the University of Toronto."
0,"First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs."

0,"While this book is not the most expensive on the market, it appears to have been created from a 'boiler-plate' of a series of canine books. Rather too much of it is not specific to Great Pyrenees. We have owned several Great Pyrenees and, from time to time, need information from reference sources. This book does not fall in to that category. It can be classified as ""Read through it once and then never refer to it again"".There are several other Great Pyrenees books on the market that more adequately describe the requirements of owning one of these large dogs. Andrew Jonson's attempt to address all matters relating to Great Pyrenees falls well short of the mark.This is not a book to recommend to potential or existing owners. Probably okay for children"
0,"If you enjoyed the rest of the series, stop and don't read this book. Yes, you will be left wondering what happens to the rest of the swords, who is the Emperor, what happens to Mark and the rest, but live with the curiosity. This book goes beyond anticlimactic, it is just awful. The ending and the explanation of the Emperor is so...I can't even find words for how disappointing it is.I'm left wondering if Saberhagen didn't outgrow the series and quickly wrote Shieldbreaker's story to bring the series to a close so he could move on to other endeavors. I can not believe that he actually thought that this ending would satisfy his readers.I can not stress enough how thoroughly disappointing and frustrating the ending of this book is. Saberhagen should personally apologize to everyone who read this book"
1,"This is the book that got me interested in reading mystery novels. It's suspenseful, thought provoking, and totally unpredictable. I have yet to find another mystery that really adds up to what Doyle has created in these few pages. I want to read all his novels now, and I can't wait!"

0,"That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a ""Loser"", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours."

1,"Finally, after over a decade of lackluster singers, Clay Aiken has arrived! His debut album, Measure of a Man, is unarguably one of the best albums of 2003. This album does not disappoint from the opening song to the last. Clay delivers every song to near perfection. His powerful instrument, his voice, resonates through each track. You will find it very hard not to listen to it, from beginning to end, over and over again. If i had to sum this album up in just one word, that word would have to be ""outstanding""!"
1,"The Executive Job-Changing Workbook by John Lucht is a Companion to Rites of Passage. It has numerous forms that are very useful in organizing a job search. It is clear, easily usable, and helps one control the organization of a varied job search. It is very cleaverly designed to take apart so that you can take one section in a briefcase on interviews. This helps recording and tracking search letters, phone calls, interviews, and thank you letters. A great help in a time consuming process."

Too bad I couldn't have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :("

1,"This was a very interesting book. As I read it I felt like Toad was a `Prodigal Son', who came back only far enough to receive acceptance, then returned to his bad habits till he was in trouble again.It reminded me much of myself, playing at being Christian before really giving Christ all areas of my life. Like Toad I would repent, but then not really change.Rat was wise and resourceful, Mole was tender and caring and awe-full like a child yet also very wise. Badger is like a wise mature old mentor or guide, sent to give direction, and lead one to find one's own purpose in life.Yet the mix of Animal and Human society just did not make sense to me. It felt like a badly planned Narnia novel. It did not explain how the animal and human worlds came to interact and share a language or culture.But over all it was a fun read even if dry in some spots.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"

0,"The back cover mentions it is a book for people with ""programming backgrounds"". I thought that meant any programming language, and I figured expertise in Turbo Pascal would count, but what it should say is ""C/C++ expertise"". If you know diddly about OOP, it doesn't help very much. It as easy to read statements like ""you invoke the method call implicitly by instantiating the object with a reference."" Mr. Van der Linden is evidently a great programmer, but not a very good teacher. If you know zilch about OOP, C, or C++, pass this one up."

0,"Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"

The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs."

This book will take you from nothing - to all you really need to know (unless you are into ""one-upsmanship"" or trying to prove something about your masculinity or lack of it). For those (who are using this forum to display their resumes) if you are insecure then you will take your stack of books and your ego and look for anything that might have been left out. You might even list all the books you have, but the truth is, if you are really good at real-life situations, whether actual military combat, law enforcement or the usual combat games, ....all the book-learning in the world is no replacement. This book is well worth what you pay for it, and that's the point of these reviews, not better-than-thou cynicism from would be intellectuals."
0,"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."

Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
0,"I bought this book, because I thought I will get some new insights on the big money lotteries, but I do not think there is anything of value there. I have the older book of Gail Howard; used to play Fantasy 5; 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 are the highest prizes I have ever won. Do not get caught by the hype: This book won't tell you how to win the big money lotteries - in fact, all that Gail Howard says is that it's very difficult to predict the Powerball ball, and the Powerball ball cannot be wheeled anyway. Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere. The book has a very long section (some 20+ pages) of ads about Howard's other books and software. Hey, you pay for that too! You'd be better off spending your $$ on a couple of extra tickets..."

0,"Well, let's not mince words here, but I thought it was a horrible movie. Being an Air Force veteran, I like movies with planes, old and new, but I have to tell you this wasn't one of them. Acting was poor for the most part, historical aspects, well they get a grade of F-, including the planes, and supposed time period. All wrong. I usually like to watch a movie, and enjoy it, without analyzing it, but this one was different, and I could not help myself. I kept hoping it might get better, but no luck. So, Nothing ventured, Nothing gained, and I would not recommend this film to anyone! Period! Adios!"

The new one is the large print version which is a rectangle - approx. 6 in. long. Additionally, the large print has other answer options - rarely, sometimes. Some very obscure items it has guessed are: angel, cruise missile (!!!! WOW), hand grenade, ant, devil, and dragon. I definitely recommend the game - for individual or group play. However, I agree that the sarcastic teasing from the game gets old fast!"

0,"It's hard to believe that the man who wrote this book (and its equally disappointing predecessor, _Foundation's Edge_) even READ the original Foundation Trilogy, let alone wrote it.This book is repetitive, tedious, and unimaginative. The conversations about collectivism vs. individuality, repeated _ad nauseum_, for all the constant hashing and rehashing of those themes, do not even skim the surface of the points of contention between them.It's bad enough that this book isn't the least bit about the Foundation(s); the real problem is that it isn't even good science fiction, and worse still, it isn't even good writing. If you enjoyed the original Foundation Trilogy, please don't bother with the last two books (chronologically) in the series. They'll only ruin the whole experience.One star. Maybe less."
0,"One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???"
1,The High Life Cannabis Cup 2005 is the highlight of my year. Over the past few years I always come back broke. This year I wanted to take home more. After careful selection I bought a Buddy that uses magnets to clean bongs. It cost ten dollars. I also bought this book because it looked good. I also bought a book called Hashish. I recommend this book for growing information and Hashish for the history. I enjoyed reading this book at the cup and I am very sure you will also.
1,This is an amazing DVD. Myself and 4 other friends worked out together and we had so much fun. We all had to sweat and enjoyed the pain the day after! This DVD is not for beginners but beginners can still try it and just take it a little bit easier!If you want to bring your body in shape -> buy this DVD! Excellent motivation and great exercise! Enjoy!!!
0,"Oh, my was this awful. It was a desperate-to-be-different movie with corny dialogue and even cornier subplots. The characters are two dimensional and are all arrogant in one way or another(other than the maid). You just can't have a ""wacky"" and risque movie; the mediums simply don't mix as is proof in this film. I am a fan of our ArtHouse movie theater, and attend regularly, but this movie was one of the worst I've seen there. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,I like the item but was misled there is no license plate holder. It is just a the adapter and you have to add a license plate holder. Otherwise you can just bolt on the license plate from the bottom. WORKS!
1,"This is not one of my favorite Travis McGee novels, although it is competently constructed, and has some good moments. Any McGee will do if I'm bored, and there's nothing else around to read. This puppy didn't really grab me until about page 66; even then, I could pull free anytime I wanted. TAN is a serviceable Hunt-For-A-Girl story. Maybe I don't much like TAN because Trav gets tied up and almost killed twice! @hg47"
0,"Yuk! is about all I can say. I loved Clay on the show but this cd sounds like one 50 min track. Save your money and get a copy used if you must. They are here for $4. If you bought This Is The Night/Bridge cd single, then you got the best. These people saying Amazing! 5 stars! must be with the Arista marketing team. They must be getting paid to log on reviews. Clay is great and Clay can sing, but this cd has three good tracks."
0,"Listen, I like Tom Brokaw as a journalist, but this book was such an obvious pander in order to sell books. It worked, he sold a lot of copies. By calling the WWII generation the ""Greatest Generation"", it gives anyone born within the general area the idea that they are great. Brokaw doesn't bother to make a distinction between the ""GI Generation"", or the people who actually marched off the war, fought a war, came home, built a middle class and thrived. And those of the ""Silent Generation"" who came a long a little later and were big on conformity in the 1950's, didn't suffer in the war or the Great Depression. I don't think just because you're old, you're great, and the author simply would not make the distinction in order to sell copies."
0,"First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour."
1,I knew this would be great. He has such an awesome voice. He can make any song great. This is the best cd I have purchased in years.
0,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
0,I just watched this for a second time after about a year. I gave it 2 stars because of its science fiction merits but would have given it one star otherwise. A group of women descend into a cavern and can't get back out due to multiple stupid mistakes and underground monsters. The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on. Many other flaws and mistakes led to their demise leaving me unsympathetic to their plight. In addition the ending was confusing. Interesting to watch regardless.
0,"Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
1,"This is quite simply one of the best horror movies ever made. And this comes from a person who watches almost nothing but horror every day. Never has a movie been so bleak since ""John Carpenter's The Thing"". Neil Marshall first made his mark on ""Dog Soldiers"", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them. None of the women are just disposable gore fodder. Bloody, disgusting, frightening, claustrophobic, amazing. This is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite, ever made."
1,"I was sick of the constant cycling my cheap programmable thermostat was doing. It would cycle my furnace and A/C every 5 to 10 minutes regardless if it needed it. This one let's you adjust that cycle temperature. I adjusted it so now it can have up to +/-2.5 degree F swing. So if you set 65 it will kick on at 63 and shut off at 67. It can be adjusted so it stays at a constant temperature as well, but I was trying to get rid of the constant cycling during cold weather. Great product so far."
0,"Dr. Sportelli has apparently made the decision to provide a very limited view of a chiropractors role. Chiropractic is not about back pain, it is concerned with the removal of interference to the nerve system, thereby allowing the body to function closer to its potential. Chiropractic has never been about ""LOW BACK PAIN""---it is this type of misconception which has permeated our society and continues to be spurred on by texts such as this. Dr. Sportelli graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic in the 1950's. He most certainly was not taught such nonsense at Palmer, for his pigeon-holed concept is not taught there, nor at any other good chiropractic college. Chiropractic recognizes and deals with the bodies inborn mechanisms. Dr. Sportelli's book was quite a disappointment in this and other respects. My advice, pass this one by and talk to someone at a college such as Palmer, Sherman or Life College and get the facts."
1,"As sad as it is that the series had to end, at least they have awesome movies to follow it up with."
0,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
1,"This 1984 release is very interesting since they recorded all tracks in 10 days straight without any overdubs. The title track, Continental Way, Twilight Solitude are the highlights of this album.

0,"too phoney, lots of errors in the way the movie was made, also bad lip syncing from the woman singer, they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise. One part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying, but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top."
1,"I thought that the Odyssey was a very good movie.It was well put together, and had great acting.The effects of the movie were average.I especially enjoyed the scenes with the cyclops.Although its a very interesting movie I believe that it is too long, and the audience/viewers gets bored.In general I thought that it was a great movie that was educational, and was very succesful.By Josh 7R."

It's telling me I need to write more words to make the review count so I'll reemphasize that this movie is a complete total waste of time and energy and you should stay away from it. Don't waste your time!"
1,"I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
1,"I enjoyed this book and i think that most people would enjoy reading about the hardships, struggles, hopes and dreams of two men during the great depression. After reading this book I felt a greater appreciation for the people who lived during this time. The book was very inspirational tome. I loved how the book made you connect with the two characters, George and Lennie, and thier hopes for the future. This book was short in text but huhe in emotions and feelings of all the charchters. Although some times I will admit that the book exaggerated the sensitivity of the character Lennie the book was still good in the fact the plot made sense with a cast of realistic characters. The ending of the book is a real life ending that wasn't far fetched. They made the events believable which causedmany emotions to stir inside you anger, fear, suspense, sorrow, and happines just to name a few. You really connect with the book. That's why I highly recommend this book."
0,The scale calibrates but then does not weigh accurately from one weighing to the next. I thought this was supposed to be medical grade?!?
1,This book has greatly inspired me to trust God in greater ways even in the details of life- concerning any needs or problems. It challenges me to reach out to others and pray confidently for them as well. I want these truths from God's word to penetrate my mind and soul till I am consistently walking in them and experiencing God's powerful presence in new ways.
1,"The message is clear.Burn the words to cover-up and control society through censorship -vs- the fire for warmth, and light for learning. Let the people make up their own minds as to which helps or hinders them.Truth, actually keeps a society in a better position (no-matter how much it seems to hurt in the present) than any ideal forward pushing utopian lies...It is a great book, and Ray's real purpose/philosophy point blankly shines in the later chapters.Thats my broadbrushstroked opinion. Amazon does not offer fine lines concerning gold stars. If they did, I would rate it 4.625"
1,"We got this printer last year and have really liked it because it works pretty fast and we wanted something to print just text so we wouldn't have to keep replacing inkjet carts. We also got aNETGEAR PS121 USB 2.0 Mini Print Serverand it has all worked on our home network pretty well together, including with a PC that runs Win 98se (which had, much to my suprise, a usb port which was mandatory to set up the print server)."
1,"I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!"
1,"I picked up this version of the herbal Magick books because I wanted to see what mr Beyerl had t offer to this vast and sometimes conflicting magickal practice.After reading through the book and using the index to find what I am nedding I must say where is ""The Master Book Of Herbalism?"" I want it..Mr Beyerl has done tons and tons of research on this material (check out the Bibliography) and it shows. His entries are precise with magical associations, common names, and other names.. It also includes suggestions for use.Not only that but, it takes the time to explaint he various ways to use herbs.This is a wonderfull addition to any occult library.."

0,"I had to read this for school, and it was hard for me to look at it. There is no action, no humor, no excitement whatsoever. There is a lot of detail, but that is only on one person. All that really happens is the girl, Kit meets a lonely old lady who is nice to her. She isn't even a witch. I say that this is the worst book in the world. I think that it's like eating pure cocoa. So bitter, bland and boring."
0,"I think this book isn't worth the money you pay for it. Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid. So it is a great effort reading it.I have to read this book at school and I do not have any motivation to analyze it."
0,"I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update."
1,What else can I say? All that love CB should own this DVD. I love Charlie Brown and this is a true Christmas classic.
0,"This book has been extoled over and over to me throughout the years. I tried it about 5 yrs ago and quit after 30 or so pages, but this time when my book group chose it, I was determined to try it again. After all I'm 5 years older. I read it slowly, tried not to analyze it too deeply and become immersed in the flow of the culture. About l00 pages into it, I thought this is really creative and interesting. Fifty pages later, I was bored with its redundancy of characters, names and magical events. It picked up again in the last 50 pages, but it NEVER did for me what so many of the previous readers exclaimed about. I was disappointed. This is one book that didn't live up to its hype."
1,"I've only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, so good. The wart is shrinking, so I'll continue using it for several more weeks until I'm sure that it's gone. I like the stick much better than a liquid. It's also less expensive to use than the pads."
0,We have a 5mo old baby boy and his 18pounds not 19 just yet. We just bought the #3 on 3/5/12. This size leaks everything!I rate #3 A BIG ZERO. Don't get us wrong we loved loved loved #1 & 2's maybe because it had the leak lock.#3 is not made right. The plastic inside directs anything..pee or poop right out. Our baby leaked both things from the back and around the thighs. OMG we had to change his entire outfit 4 times in one day.I wish we can get our money back but we threw the box in trash =( Diapers are expensive. Stores should have some sort of policy where parents can get their money back esp if they have not opened the 2nd pack and hardly used the 1st.I will keep you posted what happens and what we find that works for us. Good luck everyone
1,"Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective."
0,"Anyon wrote a provocative article a number of years ago which I still use in my teacher education classes. But this new book is troubling to me. She fails to look at the national systemic causes of institutional racism and seems to blame those in the local schools. I don't know New Jersey - maybe she is right about that city. But I do know other urban districts, and it is natioanl systems of testing, curriculum, funding, bureaucracy, and irrelevant teacher credentialing which oppresses both those who attempt to educate and those who attempt to be educated. The African-American teachers in New Jersey tried to tell Anyon that, but she didn't listen."

1,"Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field."
0,"This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing."
1,"A story of two men contrasting in physical & mental conditions but united in a deep & trusting bond whose dreams are shattered by life's sinister twist;is handled very well by Steinbeck's gifted touch for the realistic.His lyrical catch-scapes prove daunting & impenetrable though,hindering the flow of the dialogues bet. the characters,where the strength of the novel lies.His style of prose fits more for a screenplay,& it's no wonder that the film of this work was done so well.The end is a dissapointment when one has seen the film;nevertheless,the work is a moving portrayal of human relationships in the inevitability of man's destiny & his helplesness in trying to avert it."

0,"As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
1,"I could just say ""WOW"" and leave it at that! If you like scary movies, movies with lots of action, and movies that you finish watching and want to watch again just because IT WAS THAT GOOD......well, then buy this movie!!

1,"I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation.It has excellent reviews but battery life is one area where it's been criticized so I decided to purchase a backup before leaving. I decided against a generic battery after reading that although they're cheaper, they don't hold as good of a charge as a Canon. I purchased one from ANATOLIAN BOOKSTORE, INC. through Amazon because that was the best price I found and I was very pleased that the battery was indeed an authentic Canon and holds the same charge as the one that came with the camera.It was delivered promptly, at a good price and was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again."

I went looking for a biography of him and all I could find was children's books, and this one, which is apparently supposed to be an adult book, but is written on about a junior-high level. It seems like one of America's greatest black heroes should have had an adult biography written about him by now!"

1,"Provided that Pyramid is heard, then it will be a modern string quartet classic. Duval and company lay out different and ever shifting layers of music that terrify and bewilder the listener to the point of how do they do this? The reward is a punishing thematic piece that lays out new territory between modern classicism and jazz, where some terrifying solos result."

0,"I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."
0,"This book is absolutely useless. It only provided information normally found in a sales brouchure. There was no technical content. It only told you what you could do with SBS, not actually how to do it."
0,"I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it."

Invisible is as good as it was on the tour - but my personal favorites are The Way (co-written by Enrique Inglesias) and Perfect Day. Both will give you chills. Love you Clay. You are a tremendous role model - continue to be the wonderful human being you truly are. A fan - Diane Casserly"
0,"I bought this backpack a while ago, despite my reservations about having the opening for the laptop compartment on the side. The obvious danger is to forget closing the zipper, and it won't take much for your laptop to go flying ... Naturally I tried to be careful about closing it, but one day I must have been distracted or in a hurry, and when I took off the backpack, my laptop fell on the floor. Many other computer backpacks also have a strap that secures the laptop, and prevents it from moving around; this one doesn't. Otherwise it is quite nice and comfortable, but I won't use it for laptop duty anymore."
0,I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
1,"This book is a fictionalized account of Angela's life and her suffering from abuse, parental and then spousal. She overcame this cruel treatment to become a driving force in helping others escape from their own hell. Read it and learn."
0,"I enjoyed the storyline and charactor development. It should have been a 'good read' but was, for me, spoilt by cumbersome presentation and 'arty' expression. I was looking for a story which the theme promised but it got lost in the litteray world. Why can't these writers present ideas and thoughts simply? Complexity does not equate with 'quality'. I also deplore the trend of many a horror novel nowadays having to have a statutary gay component. What's wrong with a bit of plain old spine chilling with a touch of straight on the side?When I finished this story I was not desperately looking for another by the same author! Compare this to ""The Stake' or ""Crota' which where fun reads."
1,"I have been buying Hi-Tec for years. When I found the Altitude IV I fell in love instantly. This shoe fits great, has little break in time and still holds its sturdiness as it ages. Well recomended."
1,"I like Garwood's books; they are usually fun, romantic and easy to read and this was no exception.This book is the second of her Highland series and - though I do recommend reading all of them in order - I actually would suggest not reading them one immediately after the other because eventually you will find them a bit repetitive ( in the type of characters - that is incredible beautiful heroine that falls in love with the tough and handsome highlander that resist to admit he is in love - and also in the writing style and descriptions ). I found that if I mix these books with other author I always enjoy them better."
0,"This title, Moonstruck (BlueRay) is not widescreen , as advertised, nor are there any special features. Amazon's return policy is quite cumbersome, so I didn't bother to return it assuming a replacement would be the same. Things such as this are becoming more common with Amazon as is my dissatisfaction. They could easily lose this customer who makes about 100 purchases a year."

0,"Serves me right for not checking the viewer reviews first! I absolutely love this movie and gave away my VHS version after I ordered the DVD. So, I *still* have 4:3 screen format, not the Widescreen format I was so looking forward to. Focussing on ""content"" only would be misleading for DVD buyers, Amazon, and I'm tempted to return it. Subtract three stars for a really irritating studio decision."
1,"The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
0,Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open. Anyway I will return what is essentially a pointless product now. Very disappointed.Seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem
1,"I love this book! The cats are beautiful! It works great for needlepoint also. I only gave it a four, because I couldn't do 4.5. My main pet peeve is that the covers get changed on books and if I don't catch it, I end up with duplicates. Luckily I could look inside to compare. My copy is paperback with a ginger cat on the cover... not a tiger, otherwise it would have been a 5."

1,"Just shut your traps for a moment. It's a bit poppy, sort of indie rock, and still a throwback to the spaced out technical metal that made ""Dimension Hatross"" a transcendently unreal album. They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music. Still listenable to this day, ""Negatron"" is both emotional and coldly logical, violently lowbrow and mentally mutilatingly highbrow. Enjoy it if you have the headspace."

Now, 14 months later, right after the warrantee expired, I've called support to be informed that the unit is bad and that a repair will cost about $150.Personally, I expect a lot more from a headset that cost over $300."
1,"Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."
1,Great cast. Great episodes. Great price. I love every single episode from this series. sad to see it come to an end.
0,"This old book (written in the 1950s) is published by a labor union because mainstream publishers would not touch it. Union people love this book because it makes union leaders out to be martyrs and saviors of the world, standing up to those mean, greedy old corporate capitalists. For these authors, the story of labor is black and white, no shades of gray. Labor can do no wrong and never has done any wrong. The Molly Maguires were not draft dodgers and murderers, but innocent martyrs who got framed. The Homestead rioters were poor oppressed immigrants asserting their right to take control of steel mills, and are not not to be blamed for beating and shooting the police or trying to assassinate the company president. The western miners headed by Communist Big Bill Haywood didn't really blow up mines with dynamite, the mine owners did it just so they could blame the union. This book isn't history, it's a cartoon of history. Don't look for any balance, objectivity or nuance here."
1,"I love Clay Aiken, and I am a die-hard fan...I guess you could call me a ""Claymate."" The CD is really good, but I really would have liked to see some better-known writers (such as Neil Sedaka, who has said he would like to write for Clay) write some songs for the album and help to show off Clay's power and range. He does well on the songs here, but I know he's capable of better.A note to the negative reviewers: Most of you, I think, are either jealous of Clay of have nothing better to do. If you're going to write such horrible things about Clay, you should be doing something else with your time. You don't need to just blatantly come out and say ""Clay sucks."" It insults your own intelligence."
0,"This movie typifies the lazy, expensive, misguided Hollywood misfires of the last 20 years, with its bargain-Blade-Runner-with-more-neon sets, poorly realized characters and jarring tonal shifts. Is it for kids? Is it for adults? A comedy? Thriller? Sci-fi? Who knows! Who cares!?Even if you completely ignore the video game origins (which this movie fouls up miserably), this movie does not work on its own as intelligible entertainment. The movie feels like a poorly directed stage play, with everyone pitching for the last row, but not campy or quotable enough to be memorable.For those of you who think this is an overlooked gem, I direct you to the climax, where Koopa basically stands in the same spot on a walkway for 20 minutes, while clichd, cartoonish ""action"" unfolds on the same recycled sets around him.Another movie that tries to be everything and only succeeds at being boring and mildly nauseating. Only watch this out of sheer curiosity."
1,"In November 1820 the Nantucket whaleship Essex was attacked by an angry spermwhale, 1,500 miles off the coast of Peru. This is the true story that inspired Melville to write Moby Dick. After the Essex sank, the 20 crew members took to the open seas of the central Pacific in three whale boats. In the Heart of the Sea is a historian's account of the Nantucket whaling industry, the personalities of individuals, the destruction of the Essex and the three-month open-boat journey plagued by thirst, hunger, cannibalism, and bad management decisions. The book reads as smoothly as any novel yet is backed up by the authority of years of research by a historian specializing in Nanctucket Island (off the Cape Cod peninsula in Massachusetts)."
0,"This isn't even worth it for a basic collector. There isn't a temperature display, but the large problem here is that the temperature control switch offers NO range at all. You could for example set it to highest or lowest settings and get no difference AT All in actual temperature. Not only that but the temperature is too cold for red wine to be properly stored. I hate to be a perfectionist here but hey, isn't that why we buy these things in the first place? I've spoken with other former owners of this hassle of a cooler and heard the same review. The best part was when I called to tell Danby of the problem customer service told me the problem was an isolated problem they've never had before and that the temperature should be able to be adjusted. SO I sent back and received another, then another. None of them ever got warmer (or colder) than 45 degrees and I have sent it back a final time. KEEP SHOPPING AROUND!"
