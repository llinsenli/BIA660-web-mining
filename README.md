The Internet is essentially our largest source of data. In this course, students will learn through hands-on experience the pipeline of analyzing web content, including:

- reviewing Python programming concepts, useful modules, and analytics packages
- crawling data from the web
- parsing, transforming, and annotating the web data
- extracting features from the data to prepare for text mining
- conducting supervised and unsupervised learning to derive insights and help business decisions

A wide range NLP topics will be covered by this course, including text tokenization, part of speech, named entity recognition, vector space model, word embedding, text classification/clustering, sentiment mining, topic modeling, and application of deep learning in text analytics. For each topic, students will learn methods or algorithms that are widely used by industries, and apply them through hands-on exercises.

In addition to hands-on exercises, students need to work in team of 4 people to collaborate on projects during the course. Through the projects, students will apply learned techniques and possibly research on other techniques to creatively solve some realistic business problems.
